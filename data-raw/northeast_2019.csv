Milk production is mixed in parts of the region. In some areas, milk has peaked. Yet off some farms, output is up. Spot milk is also becoming a little harder to locate for some manufacturing needs. Cheese operations are receiving stable milk supplies this week. Mozzarella and provolone production schedules are active and inventories are growing. Some food sectors' cheese orders are slower currently. Cheddar barrel and block spot prices have increased. Several buyers are purchasing at current price levels on various market exchanges. Some market participants report interest is somewhat lower for this time of year, however market conditions are anticipated to strengthen in the near future. In the Northeast, the wholesale cheese prices for cheddar and Muenster moved down by $0.0500. Also, the process cheese prices decreased by $0.0600. The Grade A Swiss price is unchanged this week.

Although milk off the farms, and some bottlers' Class I orders have decreased, milk loads are readily available for cheesemakers' needs. Swiss cheese production is active and interest has strengthened at this time of year. Mozzarella and provolone supplies are steady to growing, but the demand is somewhat slower. Cheddar cheese demand has increased. Cheddar barrel and block spot prices have heightened and spot sales are currently active. Many market participants are speculating if current prices will remain or fall. In the Northeast, the wholesale cheese prices for cheddar and Muenster moved up by $0.0100. Also, the process cheese prices increased by $0.0375. The Grade A Swiss price climbed up $0.1050 following the release of the June 2019 Announcement of Class and Component Prices. However, the Class III skim milk price for June 2019 saw a 43 cents decline.
