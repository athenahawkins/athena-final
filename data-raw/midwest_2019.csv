These last few weeks of 2019 are providing evidence of that hesitance, as spot milk loads were reported (as of midweek) at $8 under Class III. All that said, some milk handlers are finding cheese producers willing to pay Class prices, also. Cheese plant managers are keeping overall production in check, and some are making last-minute decisions on days off over the holidays. Midwestern cheese inventories are in general balance. Some barrel producers are shifting away from barrels if possible, as markets are in a descent that reminds contacts of late 2014, the last time cheese markets were as bullish as they have been this fall. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, down $.3800 for process and down $.0625 for all other types.

Milk production is higher in the region and declining spot milk prices are evidence of that.

Expectations were not strong, as market tones are creating a hesitant buyer sentiment. Most cheese plant managers are allotting some extra days off later this week and this weekend. Still, with the extra holiday milk (as low as $5 under Class), some are running every day but Sunday. As was mentioned, spot milk is available, but there are still some premiums being reported, as well. Some cheesemakers suggest this is their first year seeing premiums on spot milk on Thanksgiving week. Cheese market tones are creating some anxiety among contacts in the region. Some are hopeful for late season Super Bowl related buying activity. Generally, though, the market tone is not on terra firma.

Expectations were not strong, as market tones are creating a hesitant buyer sentiment. Most cheese plant managers are allotting some extra days off later this week and this weekend. Still, with the extra holiday milk (as low as $5 under Class), some are running every day but Sunday. As was mentioned, spot milk is available, but there are still some premiums being reported, as well. Some cheesemakers suggest this is their first year seeing premiums on spot milk on Thanksgiving week. Cheese market tones are creating some anxiety among contacts in the region. Some are hopeful for late season Super Bowl related buying activity. Generally, though, the market tone is not on terra firma.

Barrel prices are hovering in the neighborhood of $2.40. Prices have not been this bullish since Q3 2014. For context, $2.49 was a market high in late September of that same year. Notably, by New Year's Eve, 2014 barrel prices were roughly $1 below their autumn acme. All that said, barrel producers continue to report being behind on orders. Other types of cheese producers cover a large spectrum regarding demand. Curd producers say they are experiencing a seasonal slowdown. However, some specialty cheddar makers are increasing production to 7 days per week, adding to schedules to keep up with holiday demand. Milk production reports continue to show heavier component levels. Aptly, reported milk prices saw a drop-off this week: $1.50 under Class to $1 over by midweek. Midwestern wholesale prices are up $.0050 for Swiss cuts, up $.1350 for process and up $.0525 for all other types.","The CME Group October 2019 monthly average price for barrels was $2.0224, compared to $1.7463 in September; blocks’ average price was $2.0703, compared to $2.0395 in September.

Cheddar block prices are steadily sliding from the $2 plus range, but barrel prices took a heavy hit last week which grew the price gap to an alarming $.30+, where it currently stands. A large price gap between blocks and barrels has a tendency to increase buyers' hesitation. Cheesemakers say spot milk is generally tight. However, some have reported finding deals in their respective region. Current spot milk prices range from $.25 to $1.75 over Class. Hence, cheesemakers are increasing their condensed skim and nonfat dry milk usage for fortification. Production rates are steady; most cheesemakers are on five- or six-day workweeks. Cheese inventories are somewhat balanced in the region. 

Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, down $.0600 for process, but up $.0250 for all other types.","This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 608,476 million pounds (276 metric tons) of American-type cheeses and 297,624 pounds (135 metric tons) of cream cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 42.3 million pounds of American-type and Swiss cheeses and 4.9 million pounds of cream cheese in export markets.

Requests for both block and process cheeses are strong. Calls from food service buyers, as students return to the classroom following the summer hiatus, are enough to prompt some manufacturers to push back a few shipment dates. Production is active with some processors running seven-day schedules. While school milk bottling is pulling heavy volumes away from the cheese vats, manufacturers are finding adequate amounts of milk to fill their production runs. Spot milk offers are not very prevalent so far this week, but contacts expect more discounted loads to become available over the holiday weekend. So far this week, spot milk loads moving into Class III are priced at $.50 below Class to $.50 above Class. This week last year, spot milk prices ranged from flat Class to $2 over Class.

Spot milk prices ranged from Class to $1.50 over Class III by midweek. Cheese market tones are somewhat unstable. On some exchanges, barrel prices have slipped to $.20 below block prices. Contacts question which direction the market will take to correct itself. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, up $.0350 for process and up $.0150 for all other types.

However, contacts are pointing out declining cheese inventories following the NASS June Cold Storage report on Monday. Subsequently, whether correlated or not, market prices saw a bump on Tuesday. Midwestern cheese producers have been regularly reporting tighter management of production schedules and milk intake levels since last year. Reported spot milk prices ranged from $1 under to $1 over Class. Most spot milk prices were north of flat Class. A number of cheesemakers are using internally sourced milk, but some are shopping for milk for the rest of 2019. They report having some trouble finding contracts, as milk has tightened so much in recent weeks. Cheese demand is mostly steady, but some curd and mozzarella producers reported bullish ordering this week.

Midwestern cheese producers have been regularly reporting tighter management of production schedules and milk intake levels since last year. Reported spot milk prices ranged from $1 under to $1 over Class. Most spot milk prices were north of flat Class. A number of cheesemakers are using internally sourced milk, but some are shopping for milk for the rest of 2019. They report having some trouble finding contracts, as milk has tightened so much in recent weeks.

Some suggest improved market prices have buyers a little more enticed to enter the fray. However, some specialty cheesemakers relay a slowdown week over week. Milk availability is mixed in the region. Upper Midwestern states are seeing some spot milk availability. That said, when you start to move East, milk availability begins to lighten and therefore pull from local activity. Spot milk prices ranged from Class to $1.50 under Class.

Some suggest improved market prices have buyers a little more enticed to enter the fray. However, some specialty cheesemakers relay a slowdown week over week. Milk availability is mixed in the region. Upper Midwestern states are seeing some spot milk availability. That said, when you start to move East, milk availability begins to lighten and therefore pull from local activity. Spot milk prices ranged from Class to $1.50 under Class. The $3.00 discounts from last week disappeared on slower spot milk trading in general. Cheese producers are maintaining a somewhat busy work schedule. Some report a seven-day workweek, expected to last into next month. Cheese market tones are continue to firm. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, up $.1100 for process, and up $.0050 for all other types.

Curd, specialty cheese and mozzarella/provolone producers have all reported a similar, steady order upswing in recent weeks. Cheese production has increased and some cheesemakers are reporting some deeper discounts on spot milk. The spot milk range was $.50 under to $3 under Class. Most of the prices are falling around $1 under Class. This week, spot milk prices looked a little more historically apt than in the past month. Week 25 spot milk prices were $3 to $4 under, while in 2017 during this time, spot milk ranged from $1 under to $4 under Class. Aptly, cheese producers also report fairly busy production schedules. Some plant managers suggest 7-day workweeks for the near term. In spite of the block to barrel price rift, markets are seeing some upward pressure last week and early this week. 

Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts and up $.0575 for all other types.

Timely, as some cheese plant production schedules are at full-bore. Milk for cheese production is available, relatively. Spot milk prices reported ranged from $.50 over to $1 under Class. To provide some historical comparisons, in 2017, spot milk prices were $2.50 to $6.50 under. Last year's prices ranged from $1.50 to $3.50 under Class. As a bevy of dairy farmers have shuttered in the Midwest and elsewhere in the nation, cheesemakers say they notice those losses. Health of the cheese markets is a concern to contacts in the region and elsewhere. As the CME block to barrel price rift looms at around $.25, contacts question whether block prices will abate, barrel prices will ascend, or a combination of both. Either way, contacts are leery of a price gap larger than a dime. 

Midwestern wholesale prices are up $.1300 for Swiss cuts, down $.0300 for process, but up $.0425 for all other types.

Cheese orders are picking up, from slightly to noticeably, according to producers of multiple varieties. Milk suppliers say some cheesemakers are looking to pick up more milk for the near term, into the fall. That said, milk supplies were comparatively snug. This week’s reported spot milk prices ranged from Class III to $1.50 under Class. From 2015 to 2018, during week 23, discounts averaged roughly $3.75 under Class. Some cheesemakers attempted to sell extra milk loads back onto the market at overages, although no takers were reported. Cheese markets are beginning to give some producers pause looking ahead. As barrels and blocks show a wide margin on the CME, some plant managers are reporting the predicament of booking milk in the near term. They reported recent production upticks, some at seven-day workweeks, but question how long that will last.

Cheese orders are picking up, from slightly to noticeably, according to producers of multiple varieties. Milk suppliers say some cheesemakers are looking to pick up more milk for the near term, into the fall. That said, milk supplies were comparatively snug. This week’s reported spot milk prices ranged from Class III to $1.50 under Class. From 2015 to 2018, during week 23, discounts averaged roughly $3.75 under Class. Some cheesemakers attempted to sell extra milk loads back onto the market at overages, although no takers were reported. Cheese markets are beginning to give some producers pause looking ahead. As barrels and blocks show a wide margin on the CME, some plant managers are reporting the predicament of booking milk in the near term. They reported recent production upticks, some at seven-day workweeks, but question how long that will last.

Cheese orders are picking up, from slightly to noticeably, according to producers of multiple varieties. Milk suppliers say some cheesemakers are looking to pick up more milk for the near term, into the fall. That said, milk supplies were comparatively snug. This week’s reported spot milk prices ranged from Class III to $1.50 under Class. From 2015 to 2018, during week 23, discounts averaged roughly $3.75 under Class. Some cheesemakers attempted to sell extra milk loads back onto the market at overages, although no takers were reported. Cheese markets are beginning to give some producers pause looking ahead. As barrels and blocks show a wide margin on the CME, some plant managers are reporting the predicament of booking milk in the near term. They reported recent production upticks, some at seven-day workweeks, but question how long that will last.

Cheese orders are picking up, from slightly to noticeably, according to producers of multiple varieties. Milk suppliers say some cheesemakers are looking to pick up more milk for the near term, into the fall. That said, milk supplies were comparatively snug. This week’s reported spot milk prices ranged from Class III to $1.50 under Class. From 2015 to 2018, during week 23, discounts averaged roughly $3.75 under Class. Some cheesemakers attempted to sell extra milk loads back onto the market at overages, although no takers were reported. Cheese markets are beginning to give some producers pause looking ahead. As barrels and blocks show a wide margin on the CME, some plant managers are reporting the predicament of booking milk in the near term. They reported recent production upticks, some at seven-day workweeks, but question how long that will last.

However, cheese producers report expectations are generally being met, while some say they predict the slowdown to last upwards of a month. The spot milk price range widened this week, although it is averaging flat Class. The reported spot milk range was $2 under to $2 over. Comparing the week 20 averages to past years is telling of the current downtrend in milk supplies. Last year during week 20, the average was $3 under, while in 2017 spot milk prices averaged $4.50 under Class, with discounts reaching $6 under. All said, cheese plant schedules are steady with available milk supplies, although not as many contacts report the 7-day workweeks reported in mid-May in prior years. Cheese markets have felt slippery this week. Barrel prices, which reached over the $1.70 mark late last week, have fallen to $1.60. Block prices, although steadier than barrels, are also trickling. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, up $.0850 for process and up $.0300 for all other types.

However, cheese producers report expectations are generally being met, while some say they predict the slowdown to last upwards of a month. The spot milk price range widened this week, although it is averaging flat Class. The reported spot milk range was $2 under to $2 over. Comparing the week 20 averages to past years is telling of the current downtrend in milk supplies. Last year during week 20, the average was $3 under, while in 2017 spot milk prices averaged $4.50 under Class, with discounts reaching $6 under. All said, cheese plant schedules are steady with available milk supplies, although not as many contacts report the 7-day workweeks reported in mid-May in prior years. Cheese markets have felt slippery this week. Barrel prices, which reached over the $1.70 mark late last week, have fallen to $1.60. Block prices, although steadier than barrels, are also trickling. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, up $.0850 for process and up $.0300 for all other types.

A number of Midwestern cheese producers suggest demand is growing seasonally, while others say orders have yet to pick up at this point. Milk availability is balanced to short, particularly in comparison to recent years. Current spot milk prices reported range from $1 over to $1 under Class. Most cheese contacts continue to run on internally sourced milk. With fewer spot milk offers in general, and cheese plant managers opting to ebb production schedules since the last half of 2018 when possible, regional contacts report a generally balanced cheese inventory situation. Nationwide inventories remain a concern for the long-term market situation. That said, current cheese market tones have remained steady this week. The CME block/barrel price gap expanded late last week, but barrels have rallied to gain some of that ground back early this week.

A number of Midwestern cheese producers suggest demand is growing seasonally, while others say orders have yet to pick up at this point. Milk availability is balanced to short, particularly in comparison to recent years. Current spot milk prices reported range from $1 over to $1 under Class. Most cheese contacts continue to run on internally sourced milk. With fewer spot milk offers in general, and cheese plant managers opting to ebb production schedules since the last half of 2018 when possible, regional contacts report a generally balanced cheese inventory situation. Nationwide inventories remain a concern for the long-term market situation. That said, current cheese market tones have remained steady this week. The CME block/barrel price gap expanded late last week, but barrels have rallied to gain some of that ground back early this week. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, down $.0200 for process, but up $.0125 for all other types.","Cold Storage – Cheese Summary

A number of Midwestern cheese producers suggest demand is growing seasonally, while others say orders have yet to pick up at this point. Milk availability is balanced to short, particularly in comparison to recent years. Current spot milk prices reported range from $1 over to $1 under Class. Most cheese contacts continue to run on internally sourced milk. With fewer spot milk offers in general, and cheese plant managers opting to ebb production schedules since the last half of 2018 when possible, regional contacts report a generally balanced cheese inventory situation. Nationwide inventories remain a concern for the long-term market situation. That said, current cheese market tones have remained steady this week. The CME block/barrel price gap expanded late last week, but barrels have rallied to gain some of that ground back early this week. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, down $.0200 for process, but up $.0125 for all other types.","Cold Storage – Cheese Summary

A number of Midwestern cheese producers suggest demand is growing seasonally, while others say orders have yet to pick up at this point. Milk availability is balanced to short, particularly in comparison to recent years. Current spot milk prices reported range from $1 over to $1 under Class. Most cheese contacts continue to run on internally sourced milk. With fewer spot milk offers in general, and cheese plant managers opting to ebb production schedules since the last half of 2018 when possible, regional contacts report a generally balanced cheese inventory situation. Nationwide inventories remain a concern for the long-term market situation. That said, current cheese market tones have remained steady this week. The CME block/barrel price gap expanded late last week, but barrels have rallied to gain some of that ground back early this week. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, down $.0200 for process, but up $.0125 for all other types.","Cold Storage – Cheese Summary

A number of Midwestern cheese producers suggest demand is growing seasonally, while others say orders have yet to pick up at this point. Milk availability is balanced to short, particularly in comparison to recent years. Current spot milk prices reported range from $1 over to $1 under Class. Most cheese contacts continue to run on internally sourced milk. With fewer spot milk offers in general, and cheese plant managers opting to ebb production schedules since the last half of 2018 when possible, regional contacts report a generally balanced cheese inventory situation. Nationwide inventories remain a concern for the long-term market situation. That said, current cheese market tones have remained steady this week. The CME block/barrel price gap expanded late last week, but barrels have rallied to gain some of that ground back early this week. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, down $.0200 for process, but up $.0125 for all other types.","Cold Storage – Cheese Summary

Some have said winter buying was particularly dismal in recent months. Winter weather in the Midwest and Northeast has been far from complementary to retail/restaurant cheese buying. Spot milk market activity was somewhat quiet this week. Reported spot loads ranged from Class to $1.25 under Class. Cheese production reports range from steady to increasing, meeting newly increasing demand needs. There is plenty of cheese in the country, but a number of Midwestern contacts suggest their inventories have been held in check with lower production during fall and winter. Although some minor stumbles have kept cheese markets in check, cheese contacts view the current state of the cheese markets with a somewhat bullish lens. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, up $.0525 for process and up $.1100 for all other types.","The CME Group March 2019 monthly average price for barrels, $1.4910, is up from the February average of $1.3867.

The uptick in sales activity is matching seasonal expectations, as warmer weather elicits hopes of a strong grilling season. Currently, milk is in good balance with processing needs. There are a few more spot milk loads available. Reported spot milk load prices range from $1 above to $1.25 under Class. Cheesemakers have mixed feelings on taking on the extra milk. Some are content to use only their own patrons’ milk or the milk they normally receive from current agreements. They have a desire to keep inventories capped from growing further. Others will take on the milk, especially if it can be matched to an extra cheese order. Cheese market prices are infusing a dose of uncertainty into the market.

Ready to consume snacks, such as curds, are moving well. And barrel producers also report an increase in buyer interest. The uptick in sales activity is matching seasonal expectations, as warmer weather elicits hopes of a strong grilling season. Currently, milk is in good balance with processing needs. There are a few more spot milk loads available. Reported spot milk load prices range from $1 above to $1.25 under Class. Cheesemakers have mixed feelings on taking on the extra milk. Some are content to use only their own patrons’ milk or the milk they normally receive from current agreements. They have a desire to keep inventories capped from growing further. Others will take on the milk, especially if it can be matched to an extra cheese order. Cheese market prices are infusing a dose of uncertainty into the market. The price gap on the CME between blocks and barrels had narrowed to a half cent last Friday, but now stands at $.1375.

Seasonally, expectations are not particularly high for certain producers. That said, some plant managers have picked up production as milk remains discounted week over week. Additionally, lasting winter weather in the upper Midwest has caused some closures at Class III facilities, which is pushing extra milk onto the spot market. Spot milk prices ranged from $.50 under to $2 under Class III. Cheese market tones are maintaining the ground they have gained recently. Cheese inventories are long nationally. Regionally, a number of contacts suggest respective inventories are in balance. Midwestern wholesale prices are down $.0725 for Swiss Cuts, down $.0050 for process, but up $.0125 for other types.

Reported spot milk prices ranged from $1 under to $2 under, although fewer trades were reported week over week. One thing weather has not hindered is the cheese markets, which continue to progress from their late 2018/early 2019 slump. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss Cuts, up $.0500 for barrels and up $.0275 for other types.

Plant breakdowns and weather-related issues caused some extra milk to move into cheese production, below Class price in most cases. Reported spot milk prices ranged from flat Class to $2 under. Cheese inventories have become burdensome in slower moving varieties, but a number of contacts suggest their inventories are balanced. Overall cheese production mirrors milk availability, but in some cases production schedules have been pared down in order to manage inventories. Cheese markets saw some bearish corrections after last week’s gains. Midwestern wholesale prices are down $.1200 for Swiss Cuts, but up $.1050 and up $.0775 for other types.

Football’s finale this weekend, along with upcoming basketball playoffs, have proven positive for mozzarella and provolone producers in the region. They say despite weather, things are generally running on time and orders have picked up. Some cheesemakers saw more spot milk available this week. Spot milk loads ranged from $2.75 under to $.50 over Class III. That said, the impact of current Siberian-like cold weather conditions have some cheese plant managers expecting fewer discounts near term. Cheese markets are showing some pluckiness this week. Even still, last week’s woes and general market weakness of late 2018 and early 2019 are fresh in the minds of contacts in the Midwest. Cheese producers have reported little change to production schedules week over week. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss Cuts, down $.0350 for barrels and down $.0275 for other types.

Some have reported that stores are back to normal. Plant managers who typically run a six or seven-day workweek have reported limiting work to five days when possible, depending on milk availability. More spot milk prices are zeroing in toward flat Class this week, while some discounts and overages were reported. The spot milk range is $2 under to $.50 over Class. The CME market price gap, between block and barrel prices, has returned to the $.20 range this week. Barrel producers who can shift production to other varieties and/or sell milk back on the spot market are doing so. Additionally, block producers are concerned while the large market price chasm exists. They suggest even though there is a chance barrel prices could ascend to meet block prices, the inverse possibility of block prices declining to converge with barrel prices creates hesitant buyers and a generally inferior market dynamic. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss Cuts, down $.0375 for barrels and down $.0300 other types.

That said, the milk price narrative has changed since week 1. This week’s spot milk prices ranged from $2 under to $1 over, whereas last week they were wholly discounted. Cheese sales reports from most producers point to a bullish push. That said, some expect schools and restaurants are simply refilling their stocks, and the uptick may be short lived once establishments/schools are replenished. Cheese markets remain somewhat quiet. Regarding inventories, although some regional producers relay their inventories are balanced, nationally stores are heavy.     

Midwestern wholesale prices are down $.0625 for Swiss Cuts, up $.0125 for barrels and up $.0475 for other types.
