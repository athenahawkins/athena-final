Cheese inventories are available for most orders, and thanks to steady cheese production, those stock levels have stabilized and are at comfortable levels. While demand has slowed slightly, industry sources report that retail and food service orders are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Retailers suggest that shoppers, sensitive to higher prices at the checkout, are opting for smaller packaged cheeses or looking for bargain prices. Export interest is strong within the EU, but exporters are running into some price resistance outside the EU. Restauranteurs are seeing good demand, especially in the more active tourist regions.
