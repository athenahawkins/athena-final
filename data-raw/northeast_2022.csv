Although both block and barrel prices have trended lower so far this week, blocks continued to outprice barrels through Tuesday. 

In the Northeast, wholesale cheese prices for both cheddar and Muenster are up $0.0800, and process cheese prices increased $0.0375. Grade A Swiss prices are unchanged this week.","EXPORT ASSISTANCE
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance to sell 2.2 million pounds (1,005 metric tons) of American-type cheese and 75,000 pounds (34 metric tons) of cream cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives with contracts to sell 45.6 million pounds of American-type cheeses and 4.4 million pounds of cream cheese.

Plant managers are keeping active cheese production schedules. Some dairy processing facilities continue to navigate labor issues, transportation bottlenecks, and/or supply shortages. Despite such challenges, cheese output is strong and regional inventories are sturdy. Export interest is reportedly good as global milk supplies remain tighter and U.S. cheese prices are favorable on international markets. Market participants report healthy cheese demand across domestic sectors as well. Retail sales are unchanged. While some variation exists from one locale to another, food service sales are generally level to improving. 

In the Northeast, wholesale cheese prices for both cheddar and Muenster are up $0.0100, and process cheese prices increased $0.0350. Grade A Swiss prices are up $0.2250 this week.

The DMN Northeast March 2022 monthly average price for cheddar blocks is $2.7156, compared to $2.4798 one month ago. Processed 5# sliced average price is $2.3608, compared to $2.1886 one month ago.","CME GROUP MONTHLY AVERAGES
The CME Group March 2022 monthly average price for barrels was $2.0774, compared to $1.9038 a month ago; blocks' average price was $2.1699, up from $1.9379 a month ago.

Some operations are running at, or near, capacity. Production is active for cheddar, mozzarella, and provolone. Regional cheese inventories are abundant, but healthy interest from domestic and international markets is helping to keep supplies from accumulating too rapidly. Retail demand is unchanged. Grocers continue to place sturdy cheese orders on strong customer demand. Food service sales are trending higher overall, but contacts say there is some variation across the sector. As COVID-related safety measures have dropped, recent reports indicate eatery patrons in some locations have been more eager to eat out while other cities are experiencing a slower rebound in dine-in traffic. Additionally, some full-service restaurants continue to offer reduced menu selections and/or hours of operation due to staffing and/or supply chain shortages.

In the Northeast, wholesale cheese prices for both cheddar and Muenster are up $0.0800, and process cheese prices increased $0.0100. Grade A Swiss prices are up $0.0375 this week. 

The DMN Northeast February 2022 monthly average price for cheddar blocks is $2.4798, compared to $2.5386 one month ago. Processed 5# sliced average price is $2.1886, compared to $2.1493 one month ago.","CME GROUP MONTHLY AVERAGES
The CME Group February 2022 monthly average price for barrels was $1.9038, compared to $1.8204 a month ago; blocks’ average price was $1.9379, up from $1.9065 a month ago.

Production is fairly active for cheddar, mozzarella, and provolone. However, some cheesemaking facilities are operating under capacity as plant managers contend with labor pool issues, shortages of production/packaging supplies, and transportation delays. Additionally, winter storm-related road closures have, in recent weeks, disrupted hauling routes and prevented some staff from getting to plants. Regional cheese supplies are plentiful. Inventories are available to meet current spot and contract needs. Retail demand has been receiving a boost ahead of an upcoming major sporting event this weekend. Food service sales are steady to softer as COVID wariness and safety restrictions have reportedly contributed to reduced dine-in numbers for some eateries. 

In the Northeast, wholesale cheese prices for both cheddar and Muenster are up $0.1075, and process cheese prices increased $0.1200. Grade A Swiss prices are up $0.0225 this week. 

The DMN Northeast January 2022 monthly average price for cheddar blocks is $2.5386, compared to $2.4698 one month ago. Processed 5# sliced average price is $2.1493, compared to $1.9652 one month ago.","CME GROUP MONTHLY AVERAGES
The CME Group January 2022 monthly average price for barrels was $1.8204, compared to $1.6548 a month ago; blocks’ average price was $1.9065, up from $1.8930 a month ago.

EXPORT ASSISTANCE
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance to sell 3.6 million pounds (1,655 metric tons) of American-type cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives with contracts to sell 18.7 million pounds of American-type cheeses.
