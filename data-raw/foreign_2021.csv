Demand is coming from export customers as well as internal EU buyers. This situation is not expected to meaningfully ease up for at least several months.

Manufacturers are very cautious about contracting due to uncertainty about how much they can count on producing. For manufacturers, the high demand has led to very good profit margins. Nevertheless, the stress involved in cutting deliveries to good long-time customers is worrisome. Cheese production will increase closer to capacity as milk becomes more available.

The demand comes from internal EU buyers as well as globally. However, cheese production is declining, limited by seasonally reduced milk output as the anticipated low point looms ahead. Typically, late November is when milk production declines slow, then reverse. This year may not be typical because many dairy producers are straining to cope with rising feed and transportation costs. 

Most cheese plants are scheduled to take in as much milk as they can, being confident that they can sell as much as is manufactured. Available milk inputs will keep many plants below production capacity. Cheese stocks are expected to be tighter through 2021. Many buyers are girding to face increasing cheese prices.  Foreign cheese manufactured in Western Europe is becoming more of a seller’s market.

Export buyers comment that freight costs are eclipsing freight delays as a matter of concern. Another cost concern centers around buyers seeking cheese exports for July. Many German and French cheese manufacturers seem to be enforcing higher prices for July cheese deliveries. Thus, buyers who waited to make deals are now enduring this July price increase. Buyers who can hold back until into August are moving toward that strategy. 

The July price factor is said to be related to buyer procrastination rather than cheese production schedules. Western European 2021 milk production has strengthened. Extra milk generally goes into cheese. Production of cheese is maintaining a good pace. Even so, sudden buyer interest in the short term tipped bargaining positions in favor of sellers and sellers are expecting higher prices as a result.

Delivering Western European cheese to the U.S. has been more challenging recently. One reason has been the protracted slow start to Western European 2021 milk production, mostly due to weather. The continuing saga of shipping delays is another factor slowing exports to the U.S. Finally, more COVID restrictions linger in countries such as Germany and France, where vaccine completion rates lag those in the U.S. This results in more friction in production and shipment of cheese.

Sources in Western Europe continue to project that 2021 cheese production will increase over 2020. That would ease one factor slowing exports to the U.S. Easing shipping complications once cheese production increases would go a long way toward increasing shipments to U.S. consumers. There remains strong buying interest in the U.S. for many Western European cheese varieties.

Plave is a nutty, pasteurized cow's milk cheese from the Veneto region in northern Italy. The seasonal production peak has been April in recent years. However, 2021 production and hence volumes available for export, have lagged. 

The EU cheese production seasonal cycle is similar to the milk production cycle. Thus, it is expected that 2021 cheese production will reach the seasonal peak in late April or so. With EU cheese production off to a slow start in 2021, due to lower than hoped for milk production, cheese available for export is tighter than hoped for. On the other hand, prices for new sales with April delivery are expected to be higher as a result.
