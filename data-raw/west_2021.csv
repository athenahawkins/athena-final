Cheese prices are favorable to international purchasers, who are continuing to look to the U.S. to meet current market demand. The ongoing truck driver shortage, in the region, is causing delays to loads, while export loads are facing further delays due to port congestion. Cheese market prices fluctuated through much of last week. Barrel prices on the CME on Monday, November 23rd were down $0.0075 from last Monday, while block prices increased by $0.1575. Strong international demand and tight spot availability for blocks have, reportedly, worked to push cheese block prices higher. Cheese inventories are tight, as spot purchasers continue to gobble up loads to meet increased holiday demand. Cheese producers are utilizing available supplies of milk to run busy schedules, though some producers report running below capacity due to staffing shortages.

WESTERN WHOLESALE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS
In the West, wholesale prices are down $.0525 for process, and down $.0225 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from the previous week.","COLD STORAGE – CHEESE SUMMARY

Food service demand for cheese is, reportedly, softening. Contacts suggest that worsening port congestion has caused some decline in international demand for cheese. Port congestion and a shortage of truck drivers are causing delays to shipments. Cheese prices on the CME dropped last week, as the weekly average price for barrels last week was down $.2365, while the weekly average price for blocks fell by $.1130. Contacts report that declining demand, combined with increased availability have contributed to lower prices. Cheese producers relay that milk is available for production. Some plant managers say that staffing shortages are causing them to run limited schedules, while others continue to run busy schedules.

In the West, wholesale prices are down $.1125 for process, and down $.2375 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are down $.0600 from the previous week.","DAIRY PRODUCTS REPORT – CHEESE SUMMARY

Cheese block prices, on the CME, are currently $0.37 higher than barrels. The gap in price between blocks and barrels is, reportedly, due to greater availability of barrels for spot purchasing. In recent weeks, some cheese producers have been focusing on the production of cheese barrels, due to a shortage of available block packaging. Producers are running busy schedules in the region, despite the seasonal decline in milk production.

This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 659,000 pounds (299 metric tons) of American-type cheese and 75,000 pounds (34 metric tons) of cream cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 31.8 million pounds of American-type cheeses and 8.8 million pounds of cream cheese in export markets.

When combined with butter, AMF, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 903.8 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.

International demand for cheese is strong, as current market prices are favorable to export. Contacts report that port congestion continues to cause delays to loads intended for oversea markets. Cheese markets are stable to lower. Cheese blocks have remained the same price on the CME since last Wednesday, while barrel prices have fallen by $0.0850. In recent weeks a large gap in price between blocks and barrels has developed. While both are available for spot purchasing, this gap in price has, reportedly, developed due to larger available supplies of cheese barrels. A seasonal decline in milk production has not hampered the ability of cheese producers, in the region, who continue to run busy schedules.

The CME Group July 2021 monthly average price for barrels, $1.4774, is down from the June 2021 monthly average price of $1.5639, and down from the monthly average of a year ago, $2.4080.

Cheese markets are mixed. Cheese block prices have fallen on the CME by $0.0475 since the previous report, while barrel prices are up $0.0075. Lower market prices have, reportedly, led to increased demand for cheese to export, with contacts reporting a notable demand to Asian markets. Some contacts report difficulty in obtaining transportation and shipping supplies causing delays to loads as well as increased freight costs. Production of cheese is strong in the region as producers are running full schedules to utilize available milk. Cheese is available for spot purchases.


WESTERN WHOLESALE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS
In the West, wholesale prices are down $.0125 for process, and down $.0375 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are up $0.0450 from the previous week.","CME CLOSE 
In CME Group trading Wednesday, barrels closed at $1.5975, compared to the weekly average price of $1.5931 from last week. Blocks closed at $1.4575, compared to the weekly average price of $1.5050 from last week.

EXPORT ASSISTANCE
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 50,706 pounds (23 metric tons) of Monterey Jack cheese and 152,119 pounds (69 metric tons) of cream cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 15.5 million pounds of American-type cheeses and 6.1 million pounds of cream cheese in export markets.

When combined with butter, AMF, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 737.6 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period May 24 - 28, 2021, issued weekly"

Production of cheese has remained strong in the region, causing supplies to outpace the current market demands. Over the past week, cheese market tones have been unsteady. Both cheese barrel and 40-pound blocks prices dropped from last week to the start of this week. Cheese barrels prices have recovered and are currently priced $0.0175 higher than this time last week, while block prices are currently down by $0.0350. Contacts report that the current cheese pricing is favorable for export markets and believe that this could lead to an increase in demand for export. Cheese intended for export continues to face delays due to congestion at ports; delays reportedly vary from week to week.

So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 14.5 million pounds of American-type cheeses and 5.5 million pounds of cream cheese in export markets.

When combined with butter, AMF, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 706.8 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period May 3 - 7, 2021, issued weekly"

Inventories of cheese remain mixed; blocks are available for purchase, but barrels are noted as somewhat firm, but some contacts suggest not as tight as in recent weeks. Cheese production continues to be strong, reflecting the high availability of milk in the region. Cheese market tones are firm. There is some consternation regarding the barrel price continuing to hover over the block price on the CME, however, cheese producers report market prices are in a somewhat healthy position right now. An increase in interest from Chinese importers has aided in some contacts viewing the market tones with a little more bullishness, as well.  

WESTERN WHOLESALE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS
In the West, wholesale prices are up $.0200 for process, and up $.0075 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from the previous week.","DAIRY PRODUCTS REPORT – CHEESE SUMMARY

Some contacts report improvements at ports with getting vessel space and shipping containers, making it possible to move exports more readily. The recent announcement of the cancellation of the USDA Farmers to Families Food Box program is causing manufacturers to closely monitor cheese markets, watching cheese futures for any signal of price direction and subsequent demand. With the uncertainty of what government purchases may look like, the market tone within cheese markets is more unsettled than what it had been a few weeks ago. Cheese producers are running at or near capacity. Cheese barrel stocks have tightened and supplies for cheese blocks are more readily available, causing the block/barrel price spread to narrow.

In the West, wholesale prices are up $.0950 for process, and up $.0475 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from the previous week.","CME CLOSE

EXPORT ASSISTANCE
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 456,357 pounds (207 metric tons) of Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese and 0 pounds (0 metric tons) of cream cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 12.322 million pounds of American-type cheeses and 4.4 million pounds of cream cheese in export markets.

When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 545.3 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.

Cheese manufacturers say that mozzarella cheese has continued to move well.

There is plenty of milk available, and cheese production facilities are running at or near capacity.

As a result, cheese makers have heavy inventories and are making a lot of spot offers. Manufacturers also have ample amounts of milk on hand. Contacts suggest processing facilities are getting back to normal operations following the strong winter storms last week. However, normal over the last few months has meant production that is variable. Some manufacturers are running full schedules, while others are trying to hold back.

EXPORT ASSISTANCE
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 1.971 million pounds (894 metric tons) of Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 7.463 million pounds of American-type cheeses and 2.661 million pounds of cream cheese in export markets. When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 338.2 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period February 22 - 26, 2021, issued weekly"

However, there is a lot of milk and there is a lot of cheese available. Cheese inventories are heavy. Converters and end users relay getting multiple offers from manufacturers. But buyers are still cautious. Market price volatility is creating significant challenges to forecasting cheese needs. Market participants do not want to get on the wrong end of a swing in market prices. Industry contacts suggest demand is all over the place. Retail demand is holding but losing a little steam from the pre-winter holiday season. Mozzarella demand is starting to slow as the football playoffs draw to a close. While cheese demand from some fast-food chains is strong, food service sales are still way down. Cheese sellers are holding out hope that shuttered restaurants in parts of the U.S. may be able to re-open, or open more fully soon.

The recent announcement for more government food box purchases has propelled cheese prices upwards in some cash markets and prompted a few manufacturers to ramp up their production processes. However, industry contacts suggest there is some hesitancy to push production too far. Cheese inventories are readily available, and some market participants have set aside cheese stocks with the anticipation of filling part of the government allocation. Market demand outside the program purchases is sluggish. Retail sales are softer following the winter holiday season. Food service sales remain weak. Pizza sales and short order food service sales are clearing decent volumes of cheese but cannot overcome the decrease in other sectors. Without a bit more reliable demand, cheese manufacturers are cautious to extend production and expose themselves to potential cheese market price volatility.
