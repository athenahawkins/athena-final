Cheese processing plants are functioning at or close to full capacities. Although discounted milk is available at some localities, cheese makers are cautious about taking on additional loads of milk. According to some industry contacts, cheese supplies are a bit tight, whereas others suggest plenty of stocks in warehouses. Both block and barrel cheese sales in the domestic market are good. In additional, international interest in blocks for 2020 is picking up due to last week declines in prices. In the West, wholesale prices were down $.2525 for process, and down $.0925 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from the previous week.

However, buyers are hesitant to take on extra loads of cheese at current price levels. While seasonal sales are flowing steadily, manufacturers suggest the run up in block prices, and now barrel prices, on the CME has squelched additional demand. Some end users are buying cheese only as needed. Contacts think production hiccups in several block facilities, heavy purchases from some food companies, and the limited amounts of fresh blocks and barrels that could come to the CME may be the reason for the price increases. These possible explanations are little solace to cheese buyers. Some processors are getting squeezed between higher cheese prices and having to raise their product prices to customers. Cheese production is steady and strong, and cheesemakers convey there is ample milk available for the vats. Inventories are adequate for block cheese, or cheese with a little age, but are tighter for fresh barrels.

Contacts think production hiccups in several block facilities, heavy purchases from some food companies, and the limited amounts of fresh blocks and barrels that could come to the CME may be the reason for the price increases. These possible explanations are little solace to cheese buyers. Some processors are getting squeezed between higher cheese prices and having to raise their product prices to customers. Cheese production is steady and strong, and cheesemakers convey there is ample milk available for the vats. Inventories are adequate for block cheese, or cheese with a little age, but are tighter for fresh barrels.

However, buyers are hesitant to take on extra loads of cheese at current price levels. While seasonal sales are flowing steadily, manufacturers suggest the run up in block prices, and now barrel prices, on the CME has squelched additional demand. Some end users are buying cheese only as needed. Contacts think production hiccups in several block facilities, heavy purchases from some food companies, and the limited amounts of fresh blocks and barrels that could come to the CME may be the reason for the price increases. These possible explanations are little solace to cheese buyers. Some processors are getting squeezed between higher cheese prices and having to raise their product prices to customers. Cheese production is steady and strong, and cheesemakers convey there is ample milk available for the vats. Inventories are adequate for block cheese, or cheese with a little age, but are tighter for fresh barrels.

Export Assistance CWT
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 965,625 pounds (438 metric tons) of cheddar. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 44.4 million pounds of American-type and Swiss cheeses in export markets.

When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 878.3 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period October 21 - 25, 2019, issued weekly"

Western cheese production is active and cheese demand is steady, but not phenomenal. Holiday orders are starting to come in and cheesemakers are somewhat unimpressed. Inventories for other natural cheese (mozzarella) are at record levels for the month of September. However, some industry contacts suggest government purchases could be helping support cheese prices. Fiscal 2019 purchases of cheese products are up approximately 14 percent from FY2018, and processed cheese buys are up nearly 40 percent. In addition, total natural cheese and American type cheese inventories are down from last year and earlier in the year. The methodical draw down could be giving the cheese market support and helping narrow the gap between block and barrel prices.

Export Assistance CWT
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 965,625 pounds (438 metric tons) of cheddar. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 44.4 million pounds of American-type and Swiss cheeses in export markets.

When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 878.3 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period October 21 - 25, 2019, issued weekly"

End users are generally not interested in taking on extra loads with market prices near the $2 mark. Instead, they prefer to work through inventories, buy only as needed and delay larger purchases until after the winter holidays, when they hope market prices might ease back. Export sales are also challenging as international buyers can find cheese at lower prices in other markets. However, some shoppers are working to get their Q4 cheese needs filled. Domestic retail accounts, food service businesses and pizza sales are engaged enough to keep U.S. cheese moving and market prices supported. Western manufacturers report cheese production is running full. And, while they would like sales to be livelier, the deals are able to keep inventories in check. Cheese stocks are heavy, but not burdensome.

End users are generally not interested in taking on extra loads with market prices near the $2 mark. Instead, they prefer to work through inventories, buy only as needed and delay larger purchases until after the winter holidays, when they hope market prices might ease back. Export sales are also challenging as international buyers can find cheese at lower prices in other markets. However, some shoppers are working to get their Q4 cheese needs filled. Domestic retail accounts, food service businesses and pizza sales are engaged enough to keep U.S. cheese moving and market prices supported. Western manufacturers report cheese production is running full. And, while they would like sales to be livelier, the deals are able to keep inventories in check. Cheese stocks are heavy, but not burdensome.

End users are generally not interested in taking on extra loads with market prices near the $2 mark. Instead, they prefer to work through inventories, buy only as needed and delay larger purchases until after the winter holidays, when they hope market prices might ease back. Export sales are also challenging as international buyers can find cheese at lower prices in other markets. However, some shoppers are working to get their Q4 cheese needs filled. Domestic retail accounts, food service businesses and pizza sales are engaged enough to keep U.S. cheese moving and market prices supported. Western manufacturers report cheese production is running full. And, while they would like sales to be livelier, the deals are able to keep inventories in check. Cheese stocks are heavy, but not burdensome.

Export Assistance CWT 
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 608,476 pounds (276 metric tons) of cheddar and Monterey Jack. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 42.3 million pounds of American-type and Swiss cheeses in export markets.

When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 819.6 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period September 23 - 27, 2019, issued weekly"

Manufacturers say there is plenty of milk available for cheesemaking and are running cheese vats at or near full capacity. Regional cheese contacts suggest barrel inventories are heavy, but block supplies are tighter. And while stockpiles of mozzarella are substantial, contacts suggest the seasonal demand from pizza makers has spoken for much of the mozzarella. Market observers speculate the tightness on blocks nationwide was behind the rise in prices on the CME, however the precipitous fall is harder to explain. Cheese demand has cooled, especially in export markets, as the price reached the apex. The block to barrel price spread has prompted some additional production of cheddar blocks, but this alone cannot be viewed as an axiomatic explanation of the price movements.

So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 41.7 million pounds of American-type and Swiss cheeses in export markets. When combined with butter, cream cheese, anhydrous milkfat, and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 818.2 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.

In CME Group trading Wednesday, barrels closed at $1.7850, compared to the weekly average price of $1.8480 from last week. Blocks closed at $2.1175, compared to the weekly average price of $2.0990 from last week.","Information for the period September 16 - 20, 2019, issued weekly"

As a result, prices are higher than usual. According to industry contacts, some domestic buyers are reluctant to make purchases above their immediate needs as they believe that the prices are inflated. Meanwhile, block cheese continues to move well through the CME. Overall, cheese production remains active with enough milk finding its way to the vats. Mozzarella demand is improving due to increased pizza sales in the region. Barrel cheese stocks are accessible because sales are not as strong as blocks. The gap between blocks and barrels has been above 20 cents for the past two weeks, so many people are asking one question: What will happen to market conditions moving forward? The strong value of the dollar is not helping with export sales. Low feed costs are likely to result in more milk production and subsequently more cheese output, which could impact the cheese market tone. In the West, wholesale prices were up $.1100 for process, and up $.1300 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from a week ago.

Strong seasonal pizza demand is promoting the production of mozzarella. And the wide spread between block and barrel prices is encouraging block production. Some industry contacts are trying to make sense of the lift in cheese prices on the CME, especially for the 40-pound block price. They see demand as adequate to keep cheese stock piles from ballooning, but export demand has been stifled by the higher market prices within the United States compared to world market prices. The daily close for blocks touched the $2 mark for the first time since November 2014 this week. Contacts suggest supplies of block cheese that meet CME trading requirements are limited, giving a push to block prices. Western cheese contacts relay that demand has been strong for block cheese, with some suppliers heavily committed over the next few months. However, with languid consumer demand for processed cheese, contacts also suggest there is currently no shortage of barrels and 640s. The concern is how well the market can regain a balance. Block and barrel prices may moderate somewhat, but the concern is that stronger milk prices and cheap feed may incentivize more milk production and, subsequently, more cheese production. A few contacts suspect that without the potential for new market opportunities, the U.S. may again have a lot of cheese that is hard to sell.

Export Assistance CWT
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 1.369 million pounds (621 metric tons) of cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 39.3 million pounds of American-type and Swiss cheeses in export markets.

When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 765.3 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period August 26 - 30, 2019, issued weekly"

Domestic consumptions of cheese are contributing to the balancing of supplies. Cheese inventories are adequate, with barrels' availability outpacing blocks. The spread between barrels and blocks has recently increased. Industry players are in wait to see if it will come down any time soon. In the interim, market conditions seem to be stable compared to last week. Cheese output is ongoing, but diverges based on milk availability in each western location. While some processors have enough milk for cheese production, others are taking extra loads of milk wherever possible. Cheese is also being fortified with nonfat dry milk.

This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 1.065 million pounds (483 metric tons) of cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 37.4 million pounds of American-type and Swiss cheeses in export markets.

While sales of cheese are generally active, they are not very strong. Some manufacturers are heavily promoting their cheese locally, hoping that it will help increase their sales. Recent trade agreements between the EU and other global cheese markets are a cause of concern for U.S. cheese producers as their international market shares might be affected in the long run. There have been some reports of increased cheese availability in the West; nonetheless, inventories have remained under control. The market undertone is steady compared to the previous week.

Production is active. And while the perception of demand may not be all that was hoped for, it is enough to keep inventories in check. Manufacturers are unphased with the small swings in stock numbers. Buyers say they do not have any trouble getting the cheese they need. The market is in relatively good balance. Grilling season has been ongoing, but with hotter weather, consumers may seek to take their eating experiences indoors until the football seasons kick off the next big push for cheese consumption. Currently, food service demand is good, but not great. Retail demand is steady, but not extraordinary. And exports have perked up with lower U.S. cash market prices and export assistance programs. A few industry contacts seem to accept that a summer lull may be setting in, but there is a lack of concern that market movements will be out of the ordinary.

Meanwhile, cheese manufacturing schedules are busier for some western producers and stable for others. Class III milk prices are flat, and supplies are available for ongoing cheese production.

On one hand, downward price pressures on barrels were noticeable in the past week as customer preferences are moving from processed to natural cheese. On the other hand, block cheese prices are increasing, causing a limitation in demand when prices are higher than $1.70. According to industry contacts, the over 20 cents price spread between blocks and barrels has a negative impact on the western cheese market. Cheese block supplies are tighter than cheese barrels, partly due to higher block cheese exports at the beginning of the year. However, both cheese types have substantial stocks, but the stocks are not overwhelming. Cheese output and sales are mainly steady. Some of the U.S. trade concerns with Mexico have been lifted because the two countries have reached agreements that avoided a trade war. In the West, wholesale prices were down $.0300 for process, but up $.0425 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are up $.1300 from the previous week.

On one hand, downward price pressures on barrels were noticeable in the past week as customer preferences are moving from processed to natural cheese. On the other hand, block cheese prices are increasing, causing a limitation in demand when prices are higher than $1.70. According to industry contacts, the over 20 cents price spread between blocks and barrels has a negative impact on the western cheese market. Cheese block supplies are tighter than cheese barrels, partly due to higher block cheese exports at the beginning of the year. However, both cheese types have substantial stocks, but the stocks are not overwhelming. Cheese output and sales are mainly steady. Some of the U.S. trade concerns with Mexico have been lifted because the two countries have reached agreements that avoided a trade war.

On one hand, downward price pressures on barrels were noticeable in the past week as customer preferences are moving from processed to natural cheese. On the other hand, block cheese prices are increasing, causing a limitation in demand when prices are higher than $1.70. According to industry contacts, the over 20 cents price spread between blocks and barrels has a negative impact on the western cheese market. Cheese block supplies are tighter than cheese barrels, partly due to higher block cheese exports at the beginning of the year. However, both cheese types have substantial stocks, but the stocks are not overwhelming. Cheese output and sales are mainly steady. Some of the U.S. trade concerns with Mexico have been lifted because the two countries have reached agreements that avoided a trade war. In the West, wholesale prices were down $.0300 for process, but up $.0425 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are up $.1300 from the previous week.

Specialty and value-added cheeses have strong buyer interest. And overall domestic retail demand is steady. However, shifts in consumer preferences from processed to natural cheeses continue to put pressure on barrel prices versus block prices within the cash market. The spread between daily block and barrel prices on the CME has gone from being equal on May 1st, to a $0.2250 premium for blocks on June 5th. The price spread is creating some challenges for barrel makers to purchase affordable milk. A few Western contacts report some discounted milk is available at $2 to $4 under Class, but they are competing with butter powder plants for the milk loads. Higher prices are also creating some headwinds for block producers, as buyers shy away from making purchases at prices at or above the $1.70 mark. Adding to the challenge are ongoing trade issues with our primary trade partners. International cheese demand seemingly ebbs and flows along with the perception of whether trade talks are going well or not. Market participants note that cheese production is steady.

Export Assistance CWT
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 1.268 million pounds (575 metric tons) of cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 28.065 million pounds of American-type and Swiss cheeses in export markets.

When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 603.7 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period June 3 - 7, 2019, issued weekly"

Specialty and value-added cheeses have strong buyer interest. And overall domestic retail demand is steady. However, shifts in consumer preferences from processed to natural cheeses continue to put pressure on barrel prices versus block prices within the cash market. The spread between daily block and barrel prices on the CME has gone from being equal on May 1st, to a $0.2250 premium for blocks on June 5th. The price spread is creating some challenges for barrel makers to purchase affordable milk. A few Western contacts report some discounted milk is available at $2 to $4 under Class, but they are competing with butter powder plants for the milk loads. Higher prices are also creating some headwinds for block producers, as buyers shy away from making purchases at prices at or above the $1.70 mark. Adding to the challenge are ongoing trade issues with our primary trade partners. International cheese demand seemingly ebbs and flows along with the perception of whether trade talks are going well or not. Market participants note that cheese production is steady. Cheese stocks are heavy, but end users say they are not getting inundated with offers.

Export Assistance CWT
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 1.268 million pounds (575 metric tons) of cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 28.065 million pounds of American-type and Swiss cheeses in export markets.

When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 603.7 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period June 3 - 7, 2019, issued weekly"

Specialty and value-added cheeses have strong buyer interest. And overall domestic retail demand is steady. However, shifts in consumer preferences from processed to natural cheeses continue to put pressure on barrel prices versus block prices within the cash market. The spread between daily block and barrel prices on the CME has gone from being equal on May 1st, to a $0.2250 premium for blocks on June 5th. The price spread is creating some challenges for barrel makers to purchase affordable milk. A few Western contacts report some discounted milk is available at $2 to $4 under Class, but they are competing with butter powder plants for the milk loads. Higher prices are also creating some headwinds for block producers, as buyers shy away from making purchases at prices at or above the $1.70 mark. Adding to the challenge are ongoing trade issues with our primary trade partners. International cheese demand seemingly ebbs and flows along with the perception of whether trade talks are going well or not. Market participants note that cheese production is steady. Cheese stocks are heavy, but end users say they are not getting inundated with offers.

Currently, block cheese demand is a bit more contingent on the prices. Some contacts mentioned that as prices move closer to $1.70, demand somewhat declines while a backpedal in prices enhances purchasers' interest. International sales have improved a bit. This could be partly due to the recent lifting of Mexico retaliatory tariffs on U.S. cheese. Several market participants are confident that cheese requests by Mexico would likely improve in the coming weeks. Cheese inventories are available, and needs can easily be satisfied. Production is steady. However, some producers are controlling their output from excessive growth.

Currently, block cheese demand is a bit more contingent on the prices. Some contacts mentioned that as prices move closer to $1.70, demand somewhat declines while a backpedal in prices enhances purchasers' interest. International sales have improved a bit. This could be partly due to the recent lifting of Mexico retaliatory tariffs on U.S. cheese. Several market participants are confident that cheese requests by Mexico would likely improve in the coming weeks. Cheese inventories are available, and needs can easily be satisfied. Production is steady. However, some producers are controlling their output from excessive growth.

In the West, wholesale prices were down $.0125 for process, but up $.0175 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from the previous week.

However, they are manageable. Milk output is plentiful for the making of cheese. As the result, cheese production is active. While some manufacturing facilities are running at full schedules, others are reducing their output to be more in control of their supplies. Contractual volumes of cheese are moving steadily. On the other hand, customers are mostly getting what they need in the short-run while being careful about long term commitments. Some of them are taking more time to reevaluate market conditions before making any major buying decision. International cheese sales are fair. The hope is that cheese demand will improve as the summer season gets near. In the West, wholesale prices were up $.0275 for process, and up $.0175 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack.

Nonetheless, some processors are attempting to control massive growth in supplies through planned output reduction. With demand not as good as they would want to and more milk available in the West, cheese production control seems to be one of the best ways to manage cheese inventories from building up too much. Cheese sales are reported as a bit mixed. Some retailers and restaurant managers are taking more cheese than usual, but others are either maintaining their intakes at the same levels or decreasing them. Contractual loads of cheese are moving as agreed upon, but additional spot sales are harder to develop despite sellers' effort to find new sale outlets. The tenor of the western cheese market is somewhat unsettled. 

In the West, wholesale prices were up $.0175 for process, but down $.0050 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from the previous week.

Some manufacturers note an increase in barrel purchases over the last few weeks. The added activity helped narrow the gap between prices for blocks and barrels on the CME last week. However, uncertainty in the market pushed the gap back up to $.1375 by mid-week. Inventories remain heavy and end users say they are getting plenty of offers. Strong milk production is filling into the cheese vats. In California, the new federal milk marketing order is reshuffling how milk flows into manufacturing facilities. Some cheese plants are holding back on production, while others are shifting production away from American-style cheeses. In some cases, cheesemakers are switching some production to other natural cheeses or specialty cheeses. In other cases, the manufacturer is diverting milk into other dairy product processing altogether. The net effect is less cheese being made in the state and more butter and milk powder.

Some manufacturers note an increase in barrel purchases over the last few weeks. The added activity helped narrow the gap between prices for blocks and barrels on the CME last week. However, uncertainty in the market pushed the gap back up to $.1375 by mid-week. Inventories remain heavy and end users say they are getting plenty of offers. Strong milk production is filling into the cheese vats. In California, the new federal milk marketing order is reshuffling how milk flows into manufacturing facilities. Some cheese plants are holding back on production, while others are shifting production away from American-style cheeses. In some cases, cheesemakers are switching some production to other natural cheeses or specialty cheeses. In other cases, the manufacturer is diverting milk into other dairy product processing altogether. The net effect is less cheese being made in the state and more butter and milk powder.

Cheese inventories are heavy, and end users say they are getting plenty of offers from cheese makers. Processors want to keep their cheese stocks in check as they enter the spring flush time of year. Some industry contacts suggest more cheese is going into aging programs or specialty products in order to better balance the cheese portfolio. Manufacturers report strong demand from domestic retail outlets and a few export channels. However, they would like to amp this demand up further to clear some additional cheese from the warehouse.

Cheese inventories are heavy, and end users say they are getting plenty of offers from cheese makers. Processors want to keep their cheese stocks in check as they enter the spring flush time of year. Some industry contacts suggest more cheese is going into aging programs or specialty products in order to better balance the cheese portfolio. Manufacturers report strong demand from domestic retail outlets and a few export channels. However, they would like to amp this demand up further to clear some additional cheese from the warehouse.

However, the vox populi of the cheese industry seems to suggest that demand is good, but not great. Industry contacts say near term spot sales are slow to develop, and recent price increases have had a cooling effect on end users' moods. Some buyers are more interested in making forward purchases into the year than current buys. Cheese facilities are operating at or near full capacity. Processors are happy to push off extra loads of milk into other manufacturing channels, especially as parts of the region enter spring flush. Cheese stocks are plentiful, and cheese makers want to keep tabs on inventories. A few industry contacts report cheese supplies are better balanced between varieties and overall, more comfortable.

However, the vox populi of the cheese industry seems to suggest that demand is good, but not great. Industry contacts say near term spot sales are slow to develop, and recent price increases have had a cooling effect on end users' moods. Some buyers are more interested in making forward purchases into the year than current buys. Cheese facilities are operating at or near full capacity. Processors are happy to push off extra loads of milk into other manufacturing channels, especially as parts of the region enter spring flush. Cheese stocks are plentiful, and cheese makers want to keep tabs on inventories. A few industry contacts report cheese supplies are better balanced between varieties and overall, more comfortable.

Demand for American style blocks and barrels is slow. Buyer interest seemingly ebbs and flows as the market price for cheese rises and falls. Cheese is moving steadily through regular contracts, but industry contacts say there does not seem to be anything right now that will give a boost to sales. However, cash market prices have risen the last few weeks leading to a cacophony of possible explanations. Some contacts suggest Q4 consumption was better than expected and the industry is seeing a bit of a refill from the winter holidays and the Super Bowl. Others say marketers are getting prepared for some upcoming export tenders. Some also report more cheese moving into aging programs. Regardless, industry contacts are in agreement that inventories are long, and demand does not seem to be at levels hoped for. Industry contacts also suggest that in the recent absence of regular market production and stock number reports, it is difficult to get a picture of true supply and demand. Manufacturers say cheese production is running mostly seven days per week, but winter storms over the weekend have slowed cheese production in some regions due to challenges transporting milk and the need to refill the bottling pipeline following the storms. Cheese makers expect production in those regions to resume normal levels soon barring any further weather or market disruptions.

Market participants hope the lower prices will generate buyer activity and draw down cheese stocks. A few cheese makers suggest their inventories are in balance. Many manufacturers are running full schedules at their cheese facilities, but some contacts suggest a few processors are starting to ease back on cheese production and diverting milk intakes toward Class IV uses.

Industry contacts acknowledge inventories are long, but there seems to be a consensus that this may be a new norm. Market participants are eager to get updated statistics on cheese production and inventories. They expect large cheese stocks in the warehouse, but are not sure how large and at what point inventories become burdensome. Some feel the storage numbers are only part of the story. A few contacts say manufacturers are placing a bit more cheese into aging programs to extract greater value out of the cheese and deal with available milk. The action may move stock numbers higher, but it better meets consumer demand trends. Cheese makers say domestic demand has been steady. Lower cheese prices on the CME have generated some interest in export markets. However, developing new export business is challenging when foreign cheese buyers expect heavy inventories to automatically mean lower prices. With increasing prices on the CME this week, a few expect more resistance to U.S. cheese offers.","Export Assistance
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 4.343 million pounds (1,970 metric tons) of cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 11.729 million pounds of American-type cheeses in export markets.

When combined with butter and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 140.6 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.

They expect large cheese stocks in the warehouse, but are not sure how large and at what point inventories become burdensome. Some feel the storage numbers are only part of the story. A few contacts say manufacturers are placing a bit more cheese into aging programs to extract greater value out of the cheese and deal with available milk. The action may move stock numbers higher, but it better meets consumer demand trends. Cheese makers say domestic demand has been steady. Lower cheese prices on the CME have generated some interest in export markets. However, developing new export business is challenging when foreign cheese buyers expect heavy inventories to automatically mean lower prices. With increasing prices on the CME this week, a few expect more resistance to U.S. cheese offers.","Export Assistance
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 4.343 million pounds (1,970 metric tons) of cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 11.729 million pounds of American-type cheeses in export markets.

When combined with butter and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 140.6 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.
