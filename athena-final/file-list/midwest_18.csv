Cheese plant managers report holiday-priced milk is flowing in, from flat to $4 under Class. Cheese demand has met expectations in general, within the Midwest. Some plant managers report current stocks are minimal, while others relay shifting production away from slower selling varieties, including curds. Some Midwestern cheese contacts are concerned about the number of dairy farms closing after feed rations dry up, particularly more remote and/or rural cheese operations with milk supplies coming from smaller, nearby dairy farms. Cheese markets have regained some momentum they lost during the fall. However, current market tones are less-than-bullish as stocks outweigh demand, nationally.

Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss Cuts and up $.0450 for all other types.

Some plant managers are shifting away from barrel production and using milk loads for other varieties, such as curds, or selling milk back into bottling in some cases. With fewer plants running at full or even normal speed, busier plant managers report running six- or seven-day weeks. Shredded cheese demand is reportedly strong. Otherwise, orders are average to slow according to a growing number of contacts. Spot milk prices are unchanged from last week: ranging between $1 to $3 under Class. After a hard Thanksgiving week on the CME, strengthening cheese markets are incongruous, at least in the short term, with participants’ expectations.

Some plant managers are shifting away from barrel production and using milk loads for other varieties, such as curds, or selling milk back into bottling in some cases. With fewer plants running at full or even normal speed, busier plant managers report running six- or seven-day weeks. Shredded cheese demand is reportedly strong. Otherwise, orders are average to slow according to a growing number of contacts. Spot milk prices are unchanged from last week: ranging between $1 to $3 under Class. After a hard Thanksgiving week on the CME, strengthening cheese markets are incongruous, at least in the short term, with participants’ expectations.

Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss Cuts, down $.0875 for process and down $.0350 for all other types.

Since Monday, barrel and block markets have both shown some resiliency. All said, cheese contacts are concerned about the potentiality of lasting market recuperation, following a bearish onset to Q4 2018. Midwestern cheese producers have downshifted production activity. Holiday work schedules are lighter than in previous years. This has helped busier producers obtain spot milk at lower costs.

A growing number of cheesemakers reported they would forego the spot market until after the Thanksgiving holiday, when discounts are expected to reappear. Milk is less available week over week, and milk handlers report getting requests that are impossible to fill on a regular basis. Reported spot milk prices ranged from $1 to $2 over Class. Cheese demand reports are varied. Some cheesemakers suggest markets are negatively affecting sales. Others suggest little to no change has occurred since the markets began their downslide, and sales are steady to improved recently. Cheese markets are still shaky. One bull of note is the large CME price gap between blocks and barrels has narrowed from October’s historically large price divide. 

Midwestern wholesale prices are up $.0950 for Swiss Cuts, up $.0700 for process, but down $.0100 for all other types.

However, there was a sign of positivity midweek, as CME barrel prices jumped up to over $1.30 for the first time since mid-October, helping to bring the price gap a little closer to normal. Specialty cheese producers suggest demand is near peak ahead of the fall holidays. Mozzarella and provolone producers also suggest demand is steady to up. Some producers report that customers who are not getting fully supplied elsewhere are calling them. Spot milk prices were reported from $.75 to $1.50 over Class III. Supplies are mixed. Freshly produced cheese is moving well. That said, some stocks produced in previous quarters are growing.

Generally, in the Midwest, cheese producers have had a healthy demand season. New customers are showing interest, and output has been steady. Retail demand and prices have also shown relative stability. All that said, cheese markets have been unforgiving to those same producers. Record price splits between process cheese and blocks, followed by continuing price slides have taken their toll. Bullish expectations remain among regional cheese producers, who foresee markets responding positively when buyers’ needs return. Cheese production has remained steady to slower, as some plants are undergoing minor updates through the next few weeks. Spot milk prices were reported from $.50 to $1.50 over Class this week. Again, very few spot milk loads were offered, and only a handful of cheesemakers are looking for milk on the spot market.

Italian and American style cheese producers are facing demand upticks at a time when spot milk prices are solely at a premium. Reported spot milk prices ranged from $.50 to $2.00 over Class III. Thus, cheese producers have relayed nonfat fortifying is at its peak. Some Midwestern cheesemakers report their nonfat stocks are down to a bare minimum. Barrel producers, particularly those in isolated areas, who are in search of spot milk are unable to take on loads at the premiums offered. Production in some plants has shifted away from barrels. Cheese market tones are bearish. There were some expectations of an amalgamation of barrel and block prices after last week’s record-breaking price gap. However, that has not been the case, and the split remains. Expectations have shifted, but some cheese contacts do foresee an uptick in barrel market prices this fall.

That said, cheesemakers who did take on milk reported prices ranging from Class to $2 over. Specialty cheesemaking is nearing its peak ahead of the fall and winter holiday season. Pizza cheese sales are steady to higher, after some pizza cheese plant managers reported a slight demand lull in late September/early October. Inventories are generally balanced on the block side, whereas barrels are longer but moving well enough to quell too much concern. Cheese markets, on the other hand, are stirring up more concern lately. Last week’s exorbitant block to barrel price gap has cheese contacts questioning how things will fall in order for prices to find their more typical alignment.

That said, cheesemakers who did take on milk reported prices ranging from Class to $2 over. Specialty cheesemaking is nearing its peak ahead of the fall and winter holiday season. Pizza cheese sales are steady to higher, after some pizza cheese plant managers reported a slight demand lull in late September/early October. Inventories are generally balanced on the block side, whereas barrels are longer but moving well enough to quell too much concern. Cheese markets, on the other hand, are stirring up more concern lately. Last week’s exorbitant block to barrel price gap has cheese contacts questioning how things will fall in order for prices to find their more typical alignment.

Fresher cheese stocks, namely Colby and cheddar, are moving well according to producers. Italian style cheesemakers are also pointing to a continued steadiness, with some expected hiccups from the impending hurricane in the East affecting orders from that region. Food service demand is seeing an uptick as schools have reopened in the Midwest. All that said, cheese producers are not expecting orders to remain as steady following market drops from the middle of week 36 and into this week. With the market instability, cheese producers expect buyers to hold off and wait for further declines. Milk availability is mixed this week. Most spot milk prices reported were at a premium, but there were some flat market prices reported as well. Spot milk prices ranged from Class to $2 over. Cheese production reports suggest steady activity levels. A number of cheese plant managers report five-day workweeks.

Demand reports throughout August have been similar. Mozzarella, provolone, and curd orders have been strong or strengthening, while cheddar/specialty producers have seen slowdowns. This week, however, orders are steady to stronger across the board. Pizza cheesemakers are citing new and returning college students as a primary factor in their continued demand upticks, not to mention an overall bump in dining out activity.

That said, a number of other varietal cheesemakers are seeing steady to increasing sales as the summer progresses. Spot milk prices are mostly up. There were some situational and/or regional loads reported at discounts as low as $4 under Class III. However, the active spot milk trading range is between $.50 under to $1.00 over Class. Cheese production varies by plant, but a growing number of Midwestern cheesemakers are allotting days off as milk becomes less available. Although the CME block to barrel price gap is large by historical standards, contacts have come to accept a fluctuating price gap as the new normal and have less trepidation regarding market uncertainty due solely to that price incongruity.

Holiday weeks can prove atypical for cheese purchasing, but there is some additional concern over the markets. Although barrel prices rebounded late last week, there were some noted reverberations felt by cheese sellers after such a swift drop. Buyers are more apprehensive, and no one on either side of the buyer/seller relationship wants to be on the wrong side of the next market fracas. Milk supplies in the region have yet to taper. Milk spot loads cleared as low as $5 under, but some regional variance in milk supplies found some cheesemakers paying as much as $2 under Class. In all cases, milk loads are available.

The overall cheese market tone is undoubtedly shaken by a laundry list of bears: trade concerns, cold storage data and recently inconsistent barrel demand to name a few. Some Midwestern process cheesemakers have shifted production into other varieties in an attempt to limit supplies and focus on better selling/seasonal items. Mozzarella and provolone makers are anxious regarding the markets, but say demand is meeting seasonal expectations nonetheless. Milk into cheese production remains discounted, between $3 to $4 under Class. Cheese plant managers expect discounts to remain into next week, ahead of Independence Day. However, as temperatures rise throughout the country, some are expecting volumes to wane following the holiday week.

The DMN National Retail Report-Dairy from June 22-28 shows that Midwest ads for 8 ounce shred cheese have a weighted average advertised price of $1.99, 33 cents below the national average. Midwest prices range from $0.99-$2.79. One year ago, the national price was $2.31. For 8 ounce blocks, the Midwest average price is $2.21, 2 cents below the national average price. Midwest ads are priced from $0.99-$3.50. Last year, the national price was $2.41.

There are some warm spots on the weather forecast ahead of grilling season, although parts of the upper Midwest are expecting heavy snow over the weekend and into next week. Spot milk remains wholly discounted, from $2 to $3.50 under Class. Some cheesemakers who took on heavy loads of spot milk last week are no longer in need of milk. Also, as some cheesemakers have turned up production over the past few weeks, they report fortifying with nonfat dry milk (NDM) in order to alleviate fairly heavy NDM stocks. The cheese markets are fairly steady. Some questions arise with contacts regarding the relatively sizeable CME block to barrel price gap, but generally Central cheese contacts view the markets with a bullish eye.
