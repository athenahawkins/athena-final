Generally, though, producers say expectations are being met on the demand side. Production is also generally unchanged week to week, with the exception of milk trading. Spot milk availability is not necessarily tight, but a number of cheese producers in the region are saying milk offers have quieted down, particularly after a couple weeks of $5 and $6 under Class III spot milk exchanges. Heat is definitely playing a part on the milk production side of things. Still, though, expectations regarding potential supplies are uncertain. Cheese market tones are fairly stable, but also questionable in potential direction. Inventories are meeting current needs, as contacts say there is a semblance of balance, regionally.

School district milk demand declines and steady weather patterns for milk production are the first two that come up on contacts' lists. Cheese production, therefore, is mostly active. The holdout for full production remains to be employee capacities not being full at the plant level. Cheese orders are steady; some contacts say sales are stable and/or meeting expectations, seasonally. Curd and barrel cheese producers say orders are strong, though. Some barrel plants, though, are running into maintenance related downtime, as order backups are being reported in the region, which is another factor in keeping milk at growing discounts. Cheese market tones are holding somewhat steady. 

Midwestern wholesale prices are up $.1750 for Swiss cuts, but down $.0325 for barrels and $.0625 for all other types.","The CME Group May monthly average price for barrels was $2.3567, compared to $2.3489 in April. The May average price for blocks was $2.3293, compared to $2.3399 in April. 

This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 2.5 million pounds (1,120 metric tons) of American-type cheese and 604,000 pounds (274 metric tons) of cream cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 47.9 million pounds of American-type cheeses and 4.4 million pounds of cream cheese in export markets.
