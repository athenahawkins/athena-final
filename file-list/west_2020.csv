And although government purchases and fast food outlets are moving good volumes of cheese, total food service is underperforming. As market cheese prices have remained high, export sales have receded. In some cases, manufacturers have had to discount cheese to move it overseas. Industry contacts say domestic market prices and freight costs are making it harder to compete in international markets. Furthermore, there is uncertainty in the domestic market as well. Parts of the nation face increasing COVID cases. As a result, market participants are concerned about further restrictions that could hamper recovery of the food service sector. Manufacturers and buyers are cautious in the production and storage of cheese that could lose value. Cheese production has been steady, but cheese makers are looking for ways to hold back volumes unless a known buyer is present. Cheese stocks are moderate. While some varieties are tight, buyers say they are not having any particular trouble getting the cheese needed.

EXPORT ASSISTANCE
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 152,119 pounds (69 metric tons) of cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 26.458 million pounds of American-type cheeses in export markets. When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 868.7 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period October 26 - 30, 2020, issued weekly"

Block inventories are tight. Manufacturers say they get regular requests from buyers, looking for available loads of cheese. Some of these buyers are trying to fill commitments made through government buying agreements. However, processors do not have much wiggle room to supply extra loads of cheese. As U.S. cash market prices have risen, demand from export buyers has cooled. But that has not freed up the cheese needed by all shoppers. Some contacts within the industry expect this may change in the next few weeks. When government purchases slow, they think supplies may increase and there may be downward pressure on cheese prices. Cheese production is active, and most plants are running at full capacity. Domestic retail demand is strong. Cheese sales into pizza are strong. But food service demand remains below typical yearly projections, and barrel supplies are readily available. Industry contacts say the block-barrel spread is making barrel production a tough proposition. Cheese companies are currently putting together their 2021 contracts. Manufacturers are expecting market conditions to be better than what they were in 2020.

EXPORT ASSISTANCE
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 354,944 pounds (161 metric tons) of cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 25.920 million pounds of American-type cheeses in export markets. When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 784.2 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period September 21 - 25, 2020, issued weekly"

While a few contacts suggest manufacturers may not be fortifying the cheese make process as heavily, others say they could sell more cheese if they had it available. As block prices have increased on the CME, cheese processors are happy to move any excess cheese to the national exchange. Inventories are mixed, being tight for American blocks and loose for barrel cheese. Mozzarella stocks are moving well through existing contracts. Industry contacts say cheese demand has been hard to predict. In general, retail demand is strong, and food service demand is weak. However, contacts report each market segment will have waves of increased activity as end users try to find the right inventory balance. In addition, government purchases, cleaning out some stocks of cheese, have added some supply challenges. Market participants have a wide range of comfort in working with the government contracts. While most in the industry like to see the increased demand, the eventual end of the purchases creates some need for caution. Cheese futures prices are below cash market prices, and end users and manufacturers do not want to be holding large supplies of cheese if program purchases come to an abrupt conclusion.


WESTERN WHOLESALE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS
In the West, wholesale prices are down $.0375 for process, but up $.2000 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from the previous week.","COLD STORAGE – CHEESE SUMMARY

EXPORT ASSISTANCE
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 1.118 million pounds (507 metric tons) of cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 23.858 million pounds of American-type cheeses in export markets. When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 766 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period August 24 - 28, 2020, issued weekly"

While prices are dropping, several market participants have not changed their buying schedules as they hope for more declines. Overall, cheese sales remain active for the retail sector, but not so much for the food service industry.

Retail demand has been the stalwart foundation for the cheese industry over the last few months. Some speculate that with summer grilling season on hand, and the safer at home mentality still fresh in consumers’ minds, demand for single serve slices has been strong. Earlier this spring, cheese processors aggressively pursued export markets, selling a lot of cheese forward overseas. However, as cash market prices have increased, industry contacts say they are now seeing fewer future export bookings. Food service demand has increased, and government purchases have developed, making cheese stocks of both blocks and barrels tight. In addition, industry contacts suggest some brokers are actively looking for cheese to close out existing contracts. But with higher prices, food service demand finding a new balance, and some export contracts getting filled, many market participants envision a scenario where cheese availability may increase, and cheese prices may fall. To some contacts, it is almost incontrovertible to think otherwise. However, there may still be enough uncertainty and market volatility to prove otherwise. Will cheese demand return to some semblance of what it was pre-COVID 19, or will current conditions morph into a new normal? How will the mix of cheese products change within retail settings? Will brands hold the same cachet as they once had with consumers? To what degree will schools, restaurants and other public sites open for food service? The industry is wrestling with these questions, and others, but at the crux of the issue is what demand may look like moving forward and how to forecast cheese needs through the rest of the year.

A few manufacturers suggest their cheese facilities are running at over 125 percent design capacity. Industry contacts report cheese supplies, although tight, are in better shape than a few weeks ago. However, it is still challenging for buyers to source the specific type and quantities of cheese they need. With the turbulent fall and rise of cheese prices, end users and suppliers are finding it more difficult to forecast market trends. Cash market prices in the U.S. have risen to a point where they are not as competitive as cheese prices from the EU. Some market observers suggest exports are slowing in response to the higher prices, making U.S. cheese a little more available. Many industry contacts think prices and demand may swing back and forth for a few months before finding some form of equilibrium.

EXPORT ASSISTANCE
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 2.945 million  pounds (1,336 metric tons) of cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 15.884 million pounds of American-type cheeses in export markets. When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 450.3 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period April 20 - 24, 2020, issued weekly"

As consumers stock up, but schools and eating establishments close, cheese demand has shifted. Manufacturers say commodity cheese sales and exports have slowed, but customers are still taking contracted shipments. Although some milk is getting diverted into Class I uses, cheese plants have plenty of milk to keep vats running at capacity. A few processors say they are making as much cheese as space allows. Inventories are available for commodity cheese, but tighter for blocks and varieties destined for retail. Some industry contacts relay that a few processors are repackaging bulk cheese to fill the surge in retail demand.

While food chain orders are trending down, retailers' intakes have increased due to many end-users stocking up for later usage. Cheese processing continues on an active tone as milk is abundant in the West. Some cheese makers had to limit how many additional loads of milk they take because of limited processing capacities. Barrel cheese inventories are more available than block cheese. The cheese market activity is slower compared to the previous week. In the West, wholesale prices were down $.0650 for process, but up $.0350 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from the previous week.

Export Assistance
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 253,532 pounds (115 metric tons) of cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 1.570 million pounds of American-type cheeses in export markets.

When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 41.4 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period February 10 - 14, 2020, issued weekly"

Export Assistance
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 152,119 pounds (69 metric tons) of cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 756,186 pounds of American-type cheeses in export markets.

When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 19.6 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period January 27 - 31, 2020, issued weekly"

Contacts are hoping for strong reorders to carry the cheese market into spring and the distant grilling season. The cold storage report released last week suggested that total cheese inventories were pulled down a bit nationwide. However, western cheese inventories did not follow that pattern. In the West, American cheese stocks grew and other natural cheese inventories were fairly stable.

Export Assistance
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 152,119 pounds (69 metric tons) of cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 756,186 pounds of American-type cheeses in export markets.

When combined with butter, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 19.6 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period January 27 - 31, 2020, issued weekly"

Industry contacts say demand is moderate, seemingly not willing to declare it either as good or bad. Cheese is moving well through current contracts, but there is a capacity to sell more cheese. Retail and food service shipments for the national cheese day, also known as the Super Bowl, have been made. Contacts are hoping for strong reorders to carry the cheese market into spring and the distant grilling season. The cold storage report released last week suggested that total cheese inventories were pulled down a bit nationwide. However, western cheese inventories did not follow that pattern. In the West, American cheese stocks grew and other natural cheese inventories were fairly stable.

Demand is steady. There is plenty of milk to keep plants running near full capacity. In some cases, manufacturers can find discounted milk to fill up processing schedules. While inventories are not necessarily burdensome, some industry contacts say they are heavy enough. With adequate cheese stocks on hand and abundant milk supplies, contacts think a few manufacturers have shifted production to barrels from blocks. As a result, the barrel cash market price has been under pressure the last month. Since the first week in December, the CME barrel weekly average price has decreased about 30 percent, while the block price has decreased about 5 percent.

Some of them are taking a break while monitoring market conditions, looking for the right time to buy. Several retailers are replenishing their stocks in the aftermath of the holidays. With the football season just a few weeks away, the hope is that there will be a revival in cheese sales. Meanwhile, cheese production is ongoing, stirred by strong milk availability in the region. There is also a good equilibrium between the quantity of cheese requested and stocks at hand. In the West, wholesale prices were down $.0150 for process, but up $.0625 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are up $.0450 from the previous week.
