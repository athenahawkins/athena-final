Nevertheless, domestic sales above contracted volumes are hard to materialize as buyers seem to have adequate supplies going into the new year. Therefore, they are not actively purchasing cheese. Requests from the international market are good. Some contacts suggest that cheese inventories have not been decreasing as fast as in previous years. In addition, abundant milk supplies are leading to strong cheese production. With the past holiday, more milk moved to the vats, and more will continue to move to Class III processing plants for balancing purpose at least up to the end of the upcoming holiday.

Nevertheless, domestic sales above contracted volumes are hard to materialize as buyers seem to have adequate supplies going into the new year. Therefore, they are not actively purchasing cheese. Requests from the international market are good. Some contacts suggest that cheese inventories have not been decreasing as fast as in previous years. In addition, abundant milk supplies are leading to strong cheese production. With the past holiday, more milk moved to the vats, and more will continue to move to Class III processing plants for balancing purpose at least up to the end of the upcoming holiday. Nonetheless, handlers are not concerned as cheese facilities have enough capacities to handle all their milk. In the West, wholesale prices were up $.0450 for process, cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from the previous week.","CME Close

Demand from mozzarella has been strong, and lower market prices have generated more interest from international buyers. Inventories are quite heavy, however. With plenty of milk on hand, market participants expect cheese production to continue to be strong. That may make it difficult for the industry to reduce the stockpiles of cheese in the near future.

Most cheese processing facilities are running either at full capacity or close to it. Stocks are more than enough to fulfill the needs of buyers. As inventories surpass demand, prices remain low although they seem to have improved a bit this week. The end of the year buying interests are stable to a bit up. According to some contacts, the low price trends in the cheese market are enhancing sales. Nonetheless, several buyers are closely monitoring prices and limiting their purchases as they have enough inventories on hand. In general, the U.S. cheese market tone is weaker, but remains competitive with their counterparts. In the West, wholesale prices were down $.0100 for process, and down $.0025 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices increased $.1275 from the previous week.

With U.S. cheese prices lower than a few months ago, there has been some renewed interest from international buyers. However, some foreign cheese prices have declined along with U.S. cheese prices, creating stiff competition in a few markets. Domestic demand has been steady but, here too, there is pressure caused by heavy cheese stocks at all market levels.

Currently, U.S. cheese prices are described as lower than that of the European Union. As so, western processors report seeing more demand from the export market, particularly from Mexico. However, the general market undertone seems mixed as some market players say that they have been seeing more push back on cheese demand this week. Cheese production remains active as milk available for its production is plentiful.  Stocks of cheese are abundant in the West, but many sellers hope to see further demand in the weeks leading to the upcoming holidays. In the West, wholesale prices are down $.0875 for process, and down $.0350 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from the previous week.

While teams playing on the gridiron have put fans into the mood for pizza, and marketers say retail and food service cheese sales have been solid, manufacturers are eager to see a demand increase for the upcoming Q4 holidays. So far, buyers have stayed mostly on the sidelines and the sales bump has yet to fully materialize. Exports have also not met expectations. Price dips may prompt some immediate activity, but not to the level desired. As a result, inventories remain heavy and are not clearing as anticipated.

According to the recently released Cold Storage report, other natural cheeses, which include mozzarella, are at record highs for the month of August. Export demand is mixed. While some sellers say cheese is moving well through contracts, others suggest persistent concerns about trade issues have diminished interest.

Retail orders are strong, and with most educational institutions back in session, some food service accounts are pulling a little more cheese. Contacts say discounted milk loads are not as readily available, but they are having no trouble getting the milk needed for processing. Cheese inventories, while heavy, are not burdensome. However, some industry contacts are a bit perplexed by the enigmatic nature of current market prices. They see steady supply and demand signals, but are trying to fathom the driving force behind the slippage of prices on the cash market. As a result, a few end users are wanting to take a wait and see approach. Until the market provides clearer price signals, they are willing to work through inventories a little more rather than make new purchases.

Some manufacturers report that sales are back up. They further suggest that they are not accepting all contractual inquiries as they have more flexibility to negotiate prices. Others report not receiving as many requests for cheese as they were getting a few weeks ago. According to them, both domestic and international sales have somewhat slowed down. The alteration of some of the U.S. trade agreements remained a concern for many market players, especially now that other countries are forging solid trade agreements with some of the U.S. main competitors. Cheese production is active despite a drop in milk volumes produced. Cheese inventories are plentiful and outpace current demand. As the pizza season approaches and educational institutions prepare to reopen, processors hope that domestic sales will reboot. Favorable trade discussion is starting to develop, giving a little more hope to industry players about the future of the cheese market.

Some manufacturers report that sales are back up. They further suggest that they are not accepting all contractual inquiries as they have more flexibility to negotiate prices. Others report not receiving as many requests for cheese as they were getting a few weeks ago. According to them, both domestic and international sales have somewhat slowed down. The alteration of some of the U.S. trade agreements remained a concern for many market players, especially now that other countries are forging solid trade agreements with some of the U.S. main competitors. Cheese production is active despite a drop in milk volumes produced. Cheese inventories are plentiful and outpace current demand. As the pizza season approaches and educational institutions prepare to reopen, processors hope that domestic sales will reboot. Favorable trade discussion is starting to develop, giving a little more hope to industry players about the future of the cheese market. In the West, wholesale prices were down $.0175 for process, and down $.0125 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged.

With current trade issues, market participants report that some overseas customers are cancelling their contractual orders. Some U.S. cheese sellers say that they are adjusting their prices downward to maintain current contracts. On the CME, barrel cheese sale activities increased since last week while block cheese trades remained sluggish. Stocks, particularly for barrel cheese are plentiful. As the result, several cheese processors are shifting their output from barrels to blocks as a way to prevent barrel inventories from increasing too much. Others are cutting down their overall production levels without switching products. The spread between the prices of blocks and barrels on the CME has widened above twenty cents. In the West, wholesale prices were down $.1925 for process and down $.0900 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged.

Cheese inventories, especially for barrels, are heavy. Domestic demand is mixed. While branded retail sales are stable, processors say food service and commodity cheese sales have slowed. In addition, industry contacts are forecasting weaker international sales due to trade issues and uncertainties of the market. Dairy contacts are concerned that reduced demand from key markets may create surpluses of cheese. In response, some manufacturers are opting to slow down cheese production to limit their inventory growth. Others are shifting from blocks to barrels in an effort to find a home for the available milk. Market observers suggest this shift in production, coupled with languid demand and plenty of barrels on the CME, has created a wide price spread between blocks and barrels. With plenty of cheese offers, buyers are in no rush to fill their inventories. End users, willing to make hand to mouth purchases, may wait for more tantalizing prices before seeking to fill their warehouses.

Cheese customers are making regular draws, but not asking for more right now. The unofficial start to summer passed last week and grilling season is upon the nation. However, terms are ending for the school year and food service demand is shifting. Buyers and manufacturers are adjusting to the new consumption patterns. In some cases, processors are planning to slow the cheese vats, despite the widespread availability of cheap milk. Manufacturers are using the slowdown as an opportune time to conduct maintenance and repairs. Inventories are healthy, but not burdensome. Industry contacts say cheese makers are making regular offers, but not at steeply discounted prices. Many feel market prices are well-supported. Contacts further say they hope export demand continues to grow, but some have lingering concerns about trade discussions, potential tariffs, currency rates, shipping and other trade issues.

Manufacturers say there is plenty of milk available and, with higher components, cheese yields are up. Industry contacts say demand is stable, but in a few cases, manufacturers report buyers have pulled back a bit on orders. Some contacts suggest that retail buyers are content with the cheese they currently have on hand and are hesitant to take on more inventory. Cheese stocks are long, especially for barrels. In addition, a few market participants say manufacturers are making more other natural (Italian) cheese instead of cheddars. The healthy production of these types of cheeses is causing inventories to grow, but also helping some processors to age some of the cheese for needs later in the year.

Each market participant is performing their own exegesis of recent reports to predict what market conditions may take hold. Buyers suggest they are getting plenty of cheese offers throughout the West, seeming to validate the idea that stockpiles are heavy. While some cheese manufacturers report a strong demand and a growing opportunity to export cheese, a few processors say they are competing against low-priced, European cheese in some international markets, such as Mexico. And although cheese contacts report a lot of sales activity, the bump for the Super Bowl did not meet expectations. There is an underlying unsettled market tone. Cheese manufacturers know that many of their facilities are already running near full capacity. With heavy milk supplies currently, there is a concern that the coming spring flush could exacerbate dairy market woes.

The DMN National Retail Report-Dairy for the week of February 23 - March 1 shows the U.S. weighted average advertised retail price for an 8 ounce pack of natural shredded cheese is $2.21, down $.10 from last week. Packs average $2.03 in the Southwest and $2.39 in the Northwest. One year ago, the national price was $2.12. For 8 ounce blocks, the U.S. price is $2.22, down $.12 from last week. Blocks average $2.36 in the Southwest and $2.19 in the Northwest. One year ago, the national price was $2.06.

In the West, wholesale prices were up $.0775 for process, and up $.0125 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from last week.","This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 1.728 million pounds (784 metric tons) of cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 18.523 million pounds of American-type cheeses in export markets.

According to the NASS Cold Storage report, U.S. stocks of cheese (total natural) at the end of January 2018 were 1.28 billion pounds, unchanged from December 2017 holdings, and up 7 percent from January 2017. American stocks were up 2 percent, Swiss stocks were up 19 percent, and other natural stocks were up 14 percent compared to last year. 

In the Mountain Region, American cheese stocks were 4 percent more than one year earlier, and 6 percent more than one month ago. Pacific Region American cheese stocks were 9 percent more than one year earlier, but 8 percent less than the previous month.
