Even as multiple plants in the region are closed for maintenance, others are running busily. Staffing shortages, at least according to some plant managers, have slowly but surely begun to improve. Cheese demand is busy, meeting seasonal expectations. Some plant managers say they are likely not going to catch up on orders until the onset of 2022, when demand is expected to settle. Cheese inventories are available here and there for spot market movements, but inventories are not overly concerning. Cheese market tones remain uncertain, but they are slowly gaining momentum as barrel prices edge higher to meet mostly steady block prices on the CME.

Midwestern wholesale prices are up $.0650 for Swiss cuts, up $.0675 for barrels, but unchanged for all other types.","The CME Group November 2021 monthly average price for barrels was $1.5375, compared to $1.8008 in October; blocks’ average price was $1.7408, compared to $1.7798 in October.

Some contacts do not foresee a short-term remedy for the current employment situation. Spot milk prices are similar to last week following the holiday weekend. Contacts say milk availability has begun to balance out after the initial school demand rush for bottled milk.

Cheese sales are strong in the region, still. Curd producers say outdoor events, such as state fairs, have locked them up at least into September. Although barrel market tones are lagging, barrel producers suggest customer interest remains intact, but availability has grown in recent months. Regarding cheese production, plant managers report an uptick in nonfat dry milk fortification measures with the lighter milk availability. The COVID-19 Delta variant is a growing concern among producers and their customers, alike.

Generally, orders are steady. Food service acquisitions are beginning to level off, but pizza cheese and process cheese producers continue to say loads are moving. Cheese producers are giving mixed notes regarding cheese availability. Some are saying they are nearly oversold, while others say inventories are slowly growing. Cheese market tones are generally steady. Cheese contacts generally view the current price points to be in a healthy trading position.

Cheese production is also steady to ticking higher in plants throughout the Midwest. Spot milk availability varies throughout the region. Some prices above the previous few weeks were reported this week, but some $5 under Class spot loads are lingering. A number of contacts suggest growing food service demand across the dairy commodity spectrum has kept general milk availability a little tighter. Cheese market tones are steady to slightly bullish.

There is some consistency this week regarding notes on spot milk: it is available. Current spot milk prices are lower on the high end than last week, but all remain discounted. Cheese demand has picked up in most cases. Food service demand is not at pre-pandemic levels, but has picked up quite a bit in the late winter/early spring season. Cheese availability reports are similar to those of production; they vary plant to plant. Some producers are saying they are moving cheese out the door, while others have some available loads here and there. Cheese market tones are mixed.

Some relay they are scheduling four day workweeks one week and six days the next. Others are still reporting robust production across the board. With food service demand deviations, a growing number of cheese plant managers are using this time to schedule plant cleaning/maintenance. Retail and some restaurant customer bases are somewhat active. Spot milk availability has tightened some. Although some discounts were reported at near last week's mid point, prices of $2 under Class III were reported, also. Some contacts suggest this could be due to more milk loads being spread out to refill depleted pipelines being refilled in the southern portion of the country, following the havoc winter systems brought last week. Cheese market tones are somewhat muted. There are a number of questions as to which direction markets will follow, including the potential of further government awards, retail/food service replenishment after most areas of the country begin to warm up, and continuously increasing milk availability moving into spring.

Spot milk prices are already reaching last week's lows, although some higher prices were reported, as well, but still notably discounted. Some cheddar producers say that retail cheese demand remains steadfast, and numbers have improved from last year during this time period. As more cities relax COVID-19 restrictions, customers are beginning to open up. Additionally, customers are more apt to place orders as cheese prices remain in or around the $1.50 to $1.60 range. Cheesemakers, who report being surprised at the current availability of spot milk, are active regarding production.
