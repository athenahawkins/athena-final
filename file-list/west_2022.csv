Labor shortages and delayed deliveries of production supplies are contributing to some reduced regional production schedules. Export demand for cheese is steady to higher, as contacts say current market prices are favorable to international purchasers. Domestic demand has seen a small uptick this week as spot purchasers have been more willing to pick up loads at current market prices. Despite this uptick, stakeholders say retail and food service sales of cheese are below some previously forecasted levels. Some grocery customers in the region say higher prices are causing grocery store shoppers to reduce their cheese use. In food service markets, restauranteurs are reducing their operating hours and their menu offerings due to labor shortages, higher input costs, and reduced customer traffic. Inventories of cheese barrels and blocks are available for spot purchasing. 

In the West, wholesale prices are up $.0550 for process, but down $0.0050 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from the previous week.","EXPORT ASSISTANCE
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 1.6 million pounds (734 metric tons) of American-type cheese and 37,000 (17 metric tons) of cream cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 62.5 million pounds of American-type cheeses and 6.5 million pounds of cream cheese in export markets.

When combined with butter, AMF, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 847 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period August 15 - 19, 2022, issued weekly"

Export demand for cheese is strong, as some Asian purchasers are buying loads to ship in the early months of 2023. Stakeholders say that domestic cheese prices remain favorable compared to prices of cheese produced in other countries. Port congestion and the ongoing shortage of truck drivers are contributing to delays in deliveries of cheese loads. Spot inventories of both blocks and barrels are available for purchase. Since last Wednesday, CME prices for barrels have fallen by 15 cents, while block prices have slid 7.5 cents lower. The NASS Cold Storage report released on May 23rd showed that total natural cheese inventories were at a record high in April. Stakeholders say that this report may have contributed some bearishness to the cheese market. Cheese producers are running busy production schedules throughout the region, as milk continues to be available. Some plant managers say that labor shortages and delayed deliveries of production supplies are causing them to run reduced production schedules.

In the West, wholesale prices are down $.0100 for process, but up $.0350 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are unchanged from the previous week.","EXPORT ASSISTANCE
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 101,000 pounds (46 metric tons) of American-type cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 42.2 million pounds of American-type cheeses and 4.1 million pounds of cream cheese in export markets.

When combined with butter, AMF, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 536 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.

EXPORT ASSISTANCE
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 3.6 million pounds (1,655 metric tons) of American-type cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 18.7 million pounds of American-type cheeses and 1.7 million pounds of cream cheese in export markets.

When combined with butter, AMF, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 279.6 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period February 7 - 11, 2022, issued weekly"

Contacts note that many restaurants in the region are operating reduced hours or are closed due to COVID concerns and labor shortages. International demand for cheese is strengthening, as contacts report increased interest from purchasers in Mexico and Asian markets. Stakeholders say that U.S. cheese prices are currently lower than European prices. Loads of cheese are facing delays due to a shortage of available truck drivers, while export loads are facing additional delays due to port congestion. Spot inventories of both cheese blocks and barrels are available to meet current market demands. Milk is available for cheese producers to run busy schedules. Some plant managers say that labor shortages and delayed deliveries of production supplies are causing them to reduce production schedules.

In the West, wholesale prices are up $.1200 for process, and up $.1075 for cheddar block, cuts and Monterey Jack. Swiss cut wholesale prices are up $.0225 from the previous week.","CME GROUP MONTHLY AVERAGES
The CME Group January 2022 monthly average price for barrels, $1.8204, is up from the December 2021 monthly average price of $1.6548, and up from the monthly average of a year ago, $1.5141.

Some contacts report that many restaurants in the region continue to remain closed due to COVID concerns and labor shortages. International demand is strong, with contacts reporting notable demand for loads to export to both Mexico and Asian markets. Export loads of cheese continue to face delays due to port congestion; some stakeholders have suggested that they are looking for alternative transportation methods to reduce these delays. Further delays to loads are occurring due to a shortage of truck drivers in the region. Cheese block and barrel inventories are available to meet current market demands. Cheese production is steady, though some plant managers say that they are running below capacity due to labor shortages.

EXPORT ASSISTANCE
This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted requests for export assistance on contracts to sell 6.4 million pounds (2,884 metric tons) of American-type cheese and 190,000 pounds (86 metric tons) of cream cheese. So far this year, the program has assisted member cooperatives who have contracts to sell 11.2 million pounds of American-type cheeses and 714,000 pounds of cream cheese in export markets.

When combined with butter, AMF, cream cheese and whole milk powder, the program has assisted members with sales of 123.4 million pounds of milk on a milkfat basis.","Information for the period January 24 - 28, 2022, issued weekly"
