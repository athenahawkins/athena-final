Producers say customers are simply waiting for the bottom to begin purchasing anything more than necessary loads. Some COVID-19 related staffing shortages have been reported, but most plant managers are fortunately continuing on less busy, albeit still regular, schedules. Limiting manufacturing schedules has kept inventories in check in the region. There are few to no reports of excessive cheese inventories, at least in recent weeks. Spot milk is readily available, and most reports this early in the week are discounts. Still, a number of cheese plant managers say they are satisfied with internal supplies.

Spot milk trading was slower again, as a number of cheesemakers are not seeking milk outside of what they have internally or coming in via contract. Available milk, along with active customers, have added to the list of cheese producer contacts who say they are running either six or seven day workweeks, even over the holiday weekend. That said, some plants have been down in order to update/maintain their facilities. Regardless, cheese production has been quite busy in the Midwest for most of the summer and things do not look to change coming into the fall. Cheese inventory notes have changed, as well. Most contacts report cheese loads are moving out the door. Cheese market tones have benefited from the announcement of continued governmental lunch box programs. The large gap between block and barrel prices on the CME does remain an issue, but weekly average prices have resoundingly answered back following the precipitous drops in July and August.

Some producers say they are very busy with orders, as markets have buoyed since the large drops earlier in the month. Buyers are active, as $2 cheese block prices are now a potentiality. However, some other producers say their orders are slowing down and inventories are not burdensome, but growing. Barrel producers echo that sentiment. They suggest inventories are slightly above current/slower demand. Milk availability is also mixed. Last week's price range, between $5 under to $1.50 over Class, could remain intact this week. Location dictates the supplies. Some plants are down for scheduled maintenance, and cheese makers expect milk to be plentiful ahead of the holiday weekend next week. As was mentioned, cheese market tones are far from the $3 mark, but have begun to show some more life this week. The relatively large block/barrel price spread on the CME, $.4250 as of Tuesday, is a looming concern.

Both food service and retail demands have kept cheesemakers busy. A number of producers report six and seven day workweeks. Milk is much less available than it was in the height of the COVID-19 effect last month, when some cheese plants were down and others were running limited schedules. At this point, all reported milk prices are at least at Class, but most are at slight overages. Cheese inventories are reportedly tight, particularly regarding block cheese. 

Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, up $.3100 for process and up $.2950 for all other types.","COLD STORAGE – CHEESE SUMMARY

Spot milk is exclusively reported at notable discounts at this point in the week. Cheese markets are resolutely bearish. Last week's precipitous price declines on the CME were unprecedented. At this point, cheese contacts are simply hopeful for a positive food service response during and following the upcoming spring holidays.     

Midwestern wholesale prices are down $.2575 for Swiss cuts, down $.2150 for process and down $.4550 for all other types.","The CME Group March 2020 monthly average price for barrels was $1.4399, compared to $1.5470 in February; blocks’ average price was $1.7550, compared to $1.8343 in February.

They say orders have slipped noticeably. Retail orders are steady to stronger, and cheese producers who work primarily or exclusively with retail accounts are busy. A number of cheesemakers wear both hats. As is expected, they are managing cheese production based upon who is ordering. Some cheese plant managers are running seven-day workweeks. Milk prices remain similarly discounted as they were last week, on quiet spot trading. Last week, milk availability was questionable with more Class I plants pulling down milk supplies in order to keep up with the retail push. This week, milk is steadily available but spot interest is limited. Cheese markets are underwhelming according to cheese contacts. Although barrel prices are pushing slowly higher, the block to barrel price gap remains notably large. This, contacts have consistently relayed, is not an indicator of steady or bullish market tones. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, down $.0025 for process, but up $.0700 for all other types.

Undoubtedly, markets are holding buyers back. Producers report that buyers are slower to move, as the $.40 CME block to barrel price gap of previous weeks has begun to narrow. Not only are markets affecting block producers, barrel producers also say sales are quiet. Spot milk availability has noticeably increased in recent weeks. Spot milk discounts beat last week's $5 under price. Cheese availability reports are mixed from balanced to growing. Production is increasing, but there is some hesitancy to add production days due to the current growth in both milk availability and cheese stocks.

So far, 2020 sales are meeting or beating expectations. As cheese markets remain in flux because of the large block-barrel price chasm, regional demand for both blocks and barrels is anything but unstable. Milk prices are holding just under Class for the most part, on slow trading. Stocks are generally balanced regionally, as well. Although national markets are flummoxed, Midwestern cheese industry conditions are mostly positive. Production activity is apace. Midwestern wholesale prices are unchanged for Swiss cuts, up $.1000 for process, and up $.0850 for all other types.

Cheese demand upticks are factored by somewhat lighter market prices when compared to late 2019 and football playoff season. Production is ongoing and picking up (across the board) after the holiday season is now in the rear view mirror. That said, at this point in the week, spot milk supplies are ample and solely at discounted rates. Cheese stores are generally balanced in the region. According to cheesemakers here, they say most loads are spoken for ahead of production. Cheese market tones are trying to find a home. The block to barrel price gap is and has been hovering around a quarter, which is not symbolic of what contacts believe to be stable markets. They prefer the price gap to be under a dime.

Cheese demand upticks are factored by somewhat lighter market prices when compared to late 2019 and football playoff season. Production is ongoing and picking up (across the board) after the holiday season is now in the rear view mirror. That said, at this point in the week, spot milk supplies are ample and solely at discounted rates. Cheese stores are generally balanced in the region. According to cheesemakers here, they say most loads are spoken for ahead of production. Cheese market tones are trying to find a home. The block to barrel price gap is and has been hovering around a quarter, which is not symbolic of what contacts believe to be stable markets. They prefer the price gap to be under a dime. Midwestern wholesale prices are up $.0450 for Swiss cuts, down $.0150 for process, but up $.0625 for all other types.
