Northeast cheese production is busy as milk continues to clear into vats. Milk availability is steady to tight as some cheese makers report they are receiving just enough loads for scheduled production levels.

The Northeast wholesale cheddar and Muenster prices decreased $0.0125, but the process cheese price increased $0.0225. The Grade A Swiss price is steady. This week, a cooperative export assistance program accepted 25 requests for export assistance to sell 4.365 million pounds (1,982 metric tons) of cheese.
